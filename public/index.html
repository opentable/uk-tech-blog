They are usually a box of fuses under the stairs that prevents the tangle of extension cords from turning into an unexpected open fireplace behind the TV. But the concept of a circuit breakers is something that we can apply to software and software services. </p>
<p>Martin Fowler described a software circuit breaker as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… a protected function call in a circuit breaker object, which monitors for failures. Once the failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit breaker trips, and all further calls to the circuit breaker return with an error, without the protected call being made at all” </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>OpenTable runs on many microservice that depend on one another to deliver the OpenTable site. These services can have dependencies on data stores such as MongoDB and Elastic Search as well as services such as RabbitMQ and Redis. Sometimes these dependencies can have performance or availability issues; such as when somebody accidentally drops an index on a collection in Mongo. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This actually happened, your author accidentally dropped a critical index while working with a DB synchronization tool which resulted in downtime. Hence this article.</p>

We provided the food, drinks, and space for an extremely talented speaker and over 100 RSVPs. It was also my first experience hosting an external meetup at OpenTable - and I learned a lot!</p>
<h2 id="My-Experience"><a href="#My-Experience" class="headerlink" title="My Experience"></a>My Experience</h2><p>OpenTable has frequently hosted meetups in our office such as <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WebPlatform-London/" target="_blank" rel="external">Web Platform London</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/webdeldn" target="_blank" rel="external">WEBdeLDN</a>. However, acting as an event host was a complete unknown for me, so leading up to the machine learning event, I made a point of sitting down with someone who had organised one before.</p>
<p>We documented the key steps in setting up an external event, and then published what we’d discussed on our internal wiki so as to avoid siloing useful information for future use. Following the steps documented in the wiki proved invaluable in reducing my stress on the day.</p>
<p>After our last event we also looked back on how we’d done the last few events.</p>

I won’t go into detail as to why we started using it, but suffice to say, we really enjoyed creating our very first GraphQL endpoint.  It eased a lot of the inconsistencies that we were experiencing with some of our REST-ful services.</p>
<p>This post assumes you have some experience building a GraphQL endpoint.  For those of who you aren’t familiar with it, it feels a lot like having a querying language via an HTTP endpoint.  If you want to try it for yourself, I recommend <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub’s endpoint</a>.  To get started with GraphQL, <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="external">the official documentation</a> is a perfect place.</p>
<h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>Now, let’s get back to writing tests for an endpoint.  When we were creating our first endpoint, we started facing regression testing problems while expanding our schema.  It seemed our existing testing methods were ill-equipped to handle it.</p>
<p>Finding a good solution to this is important because I’ve had such a love–hate affair with testing.  All tests are not created equal and a naive developer would say, “write a test in case something changes”.  This certainly isn’t a good measure.  I’ve also found that just attempting to write tests immediately without forethought can be a costly distraction if you grow your codebase.</p>

Having personally never attended a hackathon before let alone helped organise one I was initially daunted, but with some careful planning, good suggestions from the team and a fair amount of making it up as we went along, the end result was quite a success.</p>
<p>This post discusses what format our hackathon took, what challenges we faced in coordinating across countries, the experience in the London office and what we learned.</p>
<h2 id="The-basic-format"><a href="#The-basic-format" class="headerlink" title="The basic format"></a>The basic format</h2><p>The hackathon was conceived in our San Francisco headquarters and could easily have been confined to that one office, but I was delighted to learn is was intended to be a global event from the outset. The basic format, described below, was however optimised for our SF office.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the hackathon, individuals were asked to submit their hack proposals. Idea prompts were circulated such as “engages and delights diners” or “socially connected”, as well as the judging criteria; <strong>Originality</strong>, <strong>Feasibility</strong>, <strong>Likely to adopt</strong>, <strong>Fidelity of prototype</strong>, <strong>Business impact</strong> and <strong>Captivating presentation</strong>.</p>
<p>One week before the hackathon, our San Francisco office held a ‘happy-hour’ in which everyone taking part mingled and discussed ideas.  This social event encouraged the developers, designers and product owners to self-organise into teams and submit their proposals in advance.</p></div><a href="/blog/2017/06/01/opentables-global-hackathon-2017/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2017/02/15/the-goal-driven-organisation/"><h2 class="post-title">The goal driven organisation</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 15 February 2017 · <a href="/blog/categories/Culture/" class="tag post-meta">Culture</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Agile/" class="tag post-meta">Agile</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Goals/" class="tag post-meta">Goals</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Delivery/" class="tag post-meta">Delivery</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p><strong>Quarterly team goals are an effective way to establish organisational purpose, direction and alignment while supporting team agility.

<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Due to factors such as growth, acquisition, changing markets amongst others, organisations can find themselves in new environments to which they struggle to adapt.</p>
<p>Scaling Agile in these new environments is hard. The practices and tools that are frequently used to solve this problem can give the appearance of acting against team autonomy and agility. Teams and individuals naturally try to protect the engineering culture that they have worked hard to establish but by allowing new organisational needs to go unmet they put their autonomy and agility at risk.</p>
<p>In this post I will show how quarterly goal setting, using Agile principles and with one eye on the dysfunctions that can arise, is an effective way to meet organisational needs while protecting team agility and engineering culture.</p>

<h2 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a><a name="purpose"></a>Purpose</h2><p>As I am sure the audience of this post knows to some extent, <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker" target="_blank" rel="external">Docker</a> is a technology that has grown to become popular over the last few years, allowing developers to deploy pieces of software by packaging them into standardized containers, in a number of various ecosystems (Apache Mesos, Amazon Web Services and many more).</p>
<p>So we can use Docker for our deployment needs, awesome. But let’s pay attention to a key word I used above. Docker grants <em>isolation</em>. And what do we like to perform on our application in isolation? Yeah, you guessed right &ndash; testing!</p>
<p>Specifically, with this post, I aim to dig deeper into how to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank" rel="external">docker-compose</a> (a specific Docker-based tool that enables creation of multi-container Docker applications) to build and run a Node.js application connected to MongoDB, to test their interaction and the interaction of the app with the external world, all inside containers running on your machine. All isolated and testable thanks to the usage of containers that we can spin up, hit with tests, and clean up with little effort. </p>

Our project is a mobile-first, responsive web application that uses Falcor by Netflix.</p>
<p>Falcor, a JavaScript library for efficient data fetching, is an implementation of the Backend for Frontend (BFF) or the API Gateway pattern.</p>
<p>One powerful concept that Falcor has is its query model, in which you access your data as if it was a single JSON model in memory.  You can navigate your data structure the way you would navigate a JSON object; either with a “dot notation” (e.g. restaurant.address.city) or with an “array notation” (e.g. restaurant[‘address’][‘city’]). </p>
<p>Really easy and intuitive.</p>

Usually, this is very hard to achieve, in fact it took years for us to get to this point. <a href="/blog/2015/02/09/dismantling-the-monolith-microsites-at-opentable/">I described in a previous article</a> how we dismantled our monolith in favour of a Microsites architecture. Since the publication of that blog post we have been working on something I believe to be quite unique, called <strong>OpenComponents</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Another-front-end-framework"><a href="#Another-front-end-framework" class="headerlink" title="Another front-end framework?"></a>Another front-end framework?</h3><p>OpenComponents is a system to facilitate code sharing, reduce dependencies, and easily approach new features and experiments from the back-end to the front-end. To achieve this, it is based on the concept of using services as interfaces - enabling pages to render partial content that is located, executed and deployed independently.</p>
<p>OpenComponents is not <em>another SPA JS framework</em>; it is a set of conventions, patterns and tools to develop and quickly deploy fragments of front-end. In this perspective, it plays nicely with any existing architecture and framework in terms of front-end and back-end. Its purpose is to <strong>serve as delivery mechanism for a more modularised end-result in the front-end</strong>.</p>
<p>OC is been in production for more than a year at OpenTable and it is <a href="https://github.com/opentable/oc" target="_blank" rel="external">fully open-sourced</a>.</p>

<p>We all know to have stable, reliable software you need to have well written tests. Facebook knows this and<br>provides the handy <em><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Test Utilities</a></em> library to make<br>our lives easier.</p>
<p>Cool — I hear you all say! But what is the best approach to testing React components?</p>
<p>Well unfortunately this is something that is not very well documented and if not approached in<br>the correct way can lead to brittle tests.</p>
