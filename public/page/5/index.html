Performance testing in production is enough to make some operations guys have a panic attack and a few odd looks were dished my way when I raised it on behalf of the team.</p>
<h2 id="Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment"><a href="#Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment" class="headerlink" title="Why not have a dedicated environment?"></a>Why not have a dedicated environment?</h2><p>If you can have a dedicated environment that you can build to be EXACTLY the same as where you are going to really need the performance (i.e. your production environment most likely, but possibly on a client machine) then do it in a dedicated, duplicated environment. Alternatively if there is no way you can use the production environment or your model means that everything will scale exactly like production, then a duplicate environment might work.</p>
<p>For us, we had too many dependencies, mocking these out wasn’t really satisfactory and frankly, as a business where we are quiet at night, it is easy to use the production environment at these times. We use configuration management and virtual machines, much of what should help build a replica environment, but we also have machines in restaurants around the globe. That is not easy to replicate and not worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="Even-if-you-can-have-a-duplicated-environment-should-you"><a href="#Even-if-you-can-have-a-duplicated-environment-should-you" class="headerlink" title="Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?"></a>Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?</h2><p>We felt in the search team that we just wouldn’t uncover a broken server (that can affect performance) or we wouldn’t see that we had a problem with interactions with these services (we have now got to serialisation as our bottleneck, maybe we would have missed that).</p>

All was calm and it was time for bed. Two minutes later I had a phone call, followed by a series of Nagios email alerts, and a need to put my work hat on quickly. The search API was having trouble; as the manager of the team who developed it, I was not looking forward to this. We were having a real slowdown at one of our busiest times of the year &ndash; this was going to be fun.</p>
<p>Once the dust settled and we were back up and running we realised we needed to do a better job of performance testing and actually solve any performance issues. We <em>had</em> done some performance testing but clearly not the right kind.</p>
<h2 id="What-had-gone-wrong"><a href="#What-had-gone-wrong" class="headerlink" title="What had gone wrong?"></a>What had gone wrong?</h2><p>We were indexing our data too frequently, and under load it started to take a long time. We created a race condition where multiple indexing operations started happening. As each operation assumed the previous one had either failed or finished a vicious circle occurred making the situation worse and worse.</p>
<p>The simple fix was just to index the data less often or not at all if another operation was running, however we wanted to get to the bottom of why we slowed down under load which exposed this race condition, improve that speed and understand what is the maximum load the system can take.</p>

One of the projects my team is responsible for is a REST API that provides UI elements for HTML5 applications, shaped as HTML snippets and static resources. Our consumers are websites deployed in multiple parts of the world, so our service needs to be fast and reliable.</p>
<h2 id="The-why"><a href="#The-why" class="headerlink" title="The why"></a>The why</h2><p>A couple of weeks after joining the company I decided, as part of my <a href="/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time/">innovation time</a>, to rebuild the core of a .NET WebApi project in node.js in order to have a working prototype that could do exactly the same job as the original one, and could help me to observe how the two applications could react with similar volumes of traffic. After managing to make the two apis run on two clean VMs with the same configuration, I wrote a little node.js script to start performing some requests and test the response times. After seeing the results I thought that something was going wrong:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">.NET/route1 x 9.16 ops/sec ±12.71% (17 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">nodeJS/route1 x 106 ops/sec ±1.19% (180 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">======================================</div><div class="line">Fastest is nodeJS/route1</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">.NET/route2 x 10.70 ops/sec ±8.54% (19 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">nodeJS/route2 x 118 ops/sec ±1.22% (175 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">======================================</div><div class="line">Fastest is nodeJS/route2</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">======================================</div><div class="line">Fastest Service is nodeJS</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>After trying to microbenchmark different layers of the software, I found the problem. On the .NET side I was reading a file synchronously, for every request; the file system’s library used with the node.js app, instead, was automatically caching the reads as default. After setting up a basic caching mechanism in the .NET app and running my script again the node.js API was only 1.4 times faster. After finding and solving that issue I thought how badly the application could have handled concurrency when deployed in production, even if it was heavily unit tested, the specs were well defined, and it was built using all the best techniques we all love.</p>
<p>As developers we rely on technologies that, with a minimum effort, can guarantee some pretty decent results in terms of performance. Modern web frameworks handle concurrency and thread management without requiring much plumbing code. Sophisticated and relatively cheap cloud services help us monitor our applications, providing dashboards, reports and alerting systems. Deploying on the cloud we can run our services and even auto-scale them depending on how much power we need. Even with these tools we must still own the responsibility of writing good quality code, testing it properly, and deploying as fast as possible in order to optimise the delivery process of our products. </p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management/"><h2 class="post-title">Programme Management, making Agile scale</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 12 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Leadership/" class="tag post-meta">Leadership</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Agile/" class="tag post-meta">Agile</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="Popular-topic-at-conferences"><a href="#Popular-topic-at-conferences" class="headerlink" title="Popular topic at conferences"></a>Popular topic at conferences</h2><p>A lot of us were lucky enough to attend NDC London this year, we even sponsored one of the food stalls. I often see one or more real themes coming from talks at conferences. At NDC London I saw three talks around scaling Agile. Indeed Dan North’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod" target="_blank" rel="external">@tastapod</a>) talk was called exactly that. It is a topic OpenTable is trying to make happen. We are about 100 engineers on three continents which is a lot of teams working together.</p>
<p>I truly believe that the only way to make an individual team successful in an Agile environment is to have ownership of an area, a system or similar. That enables fast feedback, quick decision making and also a sense of pride and responsibility for what people are working on.</p>
<p>However, when you have a big project, you can’t give it to just one team. You need many teams working together. You can split it up and get teams to work on the parts of the project affecting the code they own. This will though mean certain parts of the project go faster than others, and if teams are autonomous, who is really responsible for bringing all those pieces together? Also, imagine you are the project owner and need to have a rough handle on when things can actually be delivered, who is going to give you that? None of the individual teams know, everyone is Agile and cool and so everyone hates estimates.</p>

We had teams of developers and operations. They rarely mixed. Around nine months ago we started to really try and get these teams working together. We introduced a configuration management tool, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet" target="_blank" rel="external">Puppet</a>, into our ecosystem. </p>
<p>Configuration management is one of the steps of continuous delivery that developers often forget. They feel that systems are magically created for them to deploy their application to. I used to believe this. When I was focused on developing software, I never gave any thought as to the work our operations team had to do to keep the train on the track. So give some respect to your operations teams! We created a repository and started to experiment by configuring some of our applications using Puppet. </p>
<p>This was a major step for both sets of teams. The developers started being in charge of the configuration of their application. This meant that their application would guarantee to be configured the same in our CI environment as it was in production. We, as developers, would be more confident of our applications working as expected. </p>
<p>To contribute to the project, as an engineer, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fork the project</li>
<li>make the changes you require</li>
<li>test the changes in a Vagrant environment (already created with a Windows and Linux system)</li>
<li>send a PR (pull request)</li>

Two days out of ten, seems a lot doesn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="How-we-started"><a href="#How-we-started" class="headerlink" title="How we started"></a>How we started</h2><p>We started doing our 20% time when we had two week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had three days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn’t like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to give it a go. </p>
<p>One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren’t bogged down for those three days. In our first 20% time, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching, let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes.</p>
<p>We got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 20% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the three day test cycle was down to about one day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number one and something no business owner had had to wrestle against other priorities.</p>
<p>After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together?</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/03/coaching-style-over-substance/"><h2 class="post-title">Coaching style over substance</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 3 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Leadership/" class="tag post-meta">Leadership</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Coaching/" class="tag post-meta">Coaching</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Have you ever been lucky enough to mentor someone who really got it?

Kolb suggested that humans have a range of learning techniques available to us and that we tend to lean on one learning style above all others.</p>
<p>In recent times his research has proved to be inaccurate - yes people have different learning styles, yes they  show an emphasis in one particular style but Kolb’s definition of separate styles was confused. </p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/03/coaching-style-over-substance/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/"><h2 class="post-title">Beginning a journey to chatops with Hubot</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 22 November 2013 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hubot/" class="tag post-meta">Hubot</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Hipchat/" class="tag post-meta">Hipchat</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Chatops/" class="tag post-meta">Chatops</a></p><div class="post-entry"><img src="/images/posts/hubot_pug_me.png" class="center">
<p>As a part of our 30% time a few of our team, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajroyle" target="_blank" rel="external">@ajroyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72" target="_blank" rel="external">@stack72</a> and I (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryantomlinson" target="_blank" rel="external">@ryantomlinson</a>) decided to get together and look at <a href="http://hubot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hubot</a> with <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hipchat</a> integration. There are several weird and wonderful scripts that ship with Hubot (see above) but the core concept of driving tooling via chat is one that we see value in.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Chatops"><a href="#What-is-Chatops" class="headerlink" title="What is Chatops?"></a>What is Chatops?</h2><p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github" target="_blank" rel="external">Chatops</a> is a term coined by Github to describe their growing culture of “putting tools in the middle of the conversation”. But what does that exactly mean?</p>
<p>To move fast and maintain stability it’s important to have a culture of automation, measurement and sharing (<a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="external">CAMS</a>). Tooling plays a key role in doing so and as your devops toolkit grows with the team there is an inherent learning and maintenance overhead. <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Github</a> made a move to centralise the conversation by driving everything they do into chat. By building tools and executing commands in a chat room that can be automated by a bot, communication doesn’t become an afterthought to operational processes but is core to how you operate. If I want to deploy code, I type a command into chat. If I want to take a server offline, I type a command into chat. If I want to merge a git pull request into master, I type in a command into chat, and so on. Communication is baked in.</p>

I wanted to be able to extend this functionality. I wanted to allow different domains to point to different areas. This would allow me to deploy the application just once and then have different headers on the web server rather than regional variances. Whilst on a flight to San Francisco, I was able to hack together some code that allows just that. The details of that hackiness are below.</p>
<p>I started with a simple ASP.NET MVC application. I then created an area. The default area registration looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>public class Domain1AreaRegistration: AreaRegistration   
{
    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute(
            &quot;Domain_1_default&quot;,
            &quot;Domain1/{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,
            new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            new[] { &quot;WebApplication.Controllers&quot; }
        );
    }

    public override string AreaName
    {
        get { return &quot;Domain1&quot;; }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The name of the folder in my project corresponds to the AreaName as above. I have approximately six areas in the application that relate to different views. Now is where the hacky magic happens. I build the routing for the application myself. In my global.asax.cs, I have the following declaration:</p>
<pre><code>protected void Application_Start()
{
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();

    //this is done using my IoC container
    var routingEngine = new RoutingEngineFactory();
    routingEngine.RoutingRegistration(RouteTable.Routes);
}
</code></pre><p>This is the creation of my RoutingEngine. This class is responsible for taking each area in the system in turn and then creating the routes for my application based on these. I am sure you are asking why I am doing that? The answer is simply that I can use a combination of MapRoute and IRouteConstraints to build a sufficient route for the URLs I need to map. The code looks as follows:</p>
