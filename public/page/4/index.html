This included our application configuration stack. IIS management is pretty easy with PowerShell. It would look something like this</p>
<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebSite -Name &quot;DemoSite&quot; -Port 80 -IP * -PhysicalPath &quot;c:\inetpub\wwwroot&quot; -ApplicationPool &quot;MyAppPool&quot;
</code></pre><p>This would of course set up a website called ‘DemoSite’ running on port 80 on the local machine. The cmdlets that come with PowerShell make this pretty easy. This is great if it is a one-off job to set up a site. We run our websites from a number of webservers, therefore, it would be silly to have to RDP into each webserver and run a script on it. This is why tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc. exist. We needed a configuration management tool to do this work for us. It has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orchestration</li>
<li>Idempotency</li>
<li>Makes sure that each server is configured in ‘exactly’ the same way as no human intervention is needed</li>
<li>Developers can help the operations team by creating the scripts needed. This is great for collaboration between teams</li>
</ul>
<p>On investigating how we would do this with Puppet, we noticed that there were not many other people managing their site in this way. Therefore, we would have to turn our PowerShell scripts into Puppet modules to manage our system. </p>
<p>We have since created a Puppet module to manage IIS. To manage IIS with Puppet, we can now write the following code:</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/05/13/managing-windows-web-applications-with-puppet/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/04/29/remote-worker-notes-tools-and-setup/"><h2 class="post-title">Remote Worker Notes &ndash; Tools and Setup</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 29 April 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Work-smarter/" class="tag post-meta">Work smarter</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Culture/" class="tag post-meta">Culture</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Agile/" class="tag post-meta">Agile</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Remote-working/" class="tag post-meta">Remote working</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>For the last couple months I’ve been working remotely with our search team at OpenTable.

<h2 id="The-deal"><a href="#The-deal" class="headerlink" title="The deal"></a>The deal</h2><p>I started as an on-site engineer and subsequently became a remote worker and my challenge was to make remote working as similar to on-site working as possible. Thus it is natural that <strong>I work the same working hours</strong> as my colleagues in the office (despite the time difference) and I take <strong>public holidays</strong> at the same time that there are bank holidays in UK (even though in Poland they are different).</p>
<p>We also decided that every two months I will <strong>visit the office for a week</strong> as well as arranging visits to coincide with other office guests (like contractors, overseas colleagues and so on). All this is to try to keep me as close to the team as possible and disrupt the normal work-flow as little as possible.</p>

<p>At OpenTable we strive to deliver change as quickly and correctly as possible. To do this effectively we are always looking for <a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/">new</a> <a href="/blog/2013/08/16/grunt-plus-vagrant-equals-acceptance-test-heaven/">tools</a> <a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/">and</a> <a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/">methods</a> that allow us, the developers, to respond quickly and accurately to changing requirements and environments.</p>
<p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I’ve ever worked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>We operate in small teams who each own <em>most</em> of their own vertical.</li>
<li>We use continuous delivery to ship code to production within minutes.</li>
<li>We have a high degree of high-quality test coverage.</li>
<li>We are getting better and better at monitoring All The Things.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/">We use Chatops</a>, so communication is central to our work, and keeps remote workers/teams in the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above are truly empowering for the dev team, and are conducive to an amazingly stress-free working environment. However, these practices only address the infrastructure, culture, and ceremony surrounding our work. What if there was something else? Something about the way we write the code itself, that could increase our velocity yet further, without compromising our integrity…</p>

<p>This should be a very straightforward task to complete because this is one of the core resources that Puppet manages - the upgrading of packages. With that in mind, putting <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> in one of our base profiles would be all that was needed but alas it was not. In this blog I want to take you through the history, the bugs, the platforms and the edge-cases that make performing an in-place upgrade of Puppet a more complex task that it ought to be.</p>
<p>##Debian<br>Like many, Ubuntu is our Debian derivative of choice for much of our newer production infrastructure. Debian, has the apt package management system and PuppetLabs provide the required deb packages as well as hosting their own apt repository to point our systems to. The main point of package management systems is that they take care of the dependency hell and the awkward upgrade paths all from within the confines of the package itself, and that is what happens with the PuppetLabs packages - great. </p>
<p>The problem that we had in some of our systems was that they had been built without the PuppetLabs apt repository. This means that they picked up a slightly older version of the Puppet packages from the main Ubuntu distribution repositories and didn’t have access to the newer versions of the Puppet packages. Ok, so we solved that with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>exec { &apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;:
  path    =&gt; &apos;/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin&apos;,
  command =&gt; &apos;sed -i \&apos;s:deb\ http\:\/\/apt.puppetlabs.com\/ precise main::\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
  onlyif  =&gt; &apos;grep \&apos;deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ precise main\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
}

apt::source { &apos;puppetlabs&apos;:
  location    =&gt; &apos;http://apt.puppetlabs.com&apos;,
  repos       =&gt; &apos;main dependencies&apos;,
  key         =&gt; &apos;4BD6EC30&apos;,
  key_content =&gt; template(&apos;puppetversion/puppetlabs.gpg&apos;),
  require     =&gt; Exec[&apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;]
}
</code></pre><p>We’re making use of the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt" target="_blank" rel="external">puppetlabs/apt</a> module here. This removes the old reference and adding in the new apt source. Then we just add the package and ensure the version we’re upgrading. Perfect.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 4 April 2014</p><div class="post-entry"><p>One afternoon I got asked to write a new Puppet module to manage local users on our Linux boxes. Not a contrived example but a real-world need as we begin to move our infrastructure from Windows to Linux. Managing users is one of those tasks that is at the core of the Puppet ecosystem and I thought this would be pretty easy as I had done this sort of thing many times before. What added to the complexity was that we needed to support Ubuntu, Centos and FreeBSD machines that we had in our stack and we wanted to make it something that was open source and on the Forge - so lots of testing was required.</p>
<p>This was not the first module that I had written for the Forge but it was the first that I had written since PuppetLabs had introduced their new acceptance testing framework <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker" target="_blank" rel="external">Beaker</a> and so I wanted to spend some time getting the module working with this new tool.</p>
<h2 id="Beaker"><a href="#Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Beaker"></a>Beaker</h2><p>The purpose of Beaker is to allow you to write acceptance tests for your modules, that is to write some manifests that use your module and test them out on a virtual machine. Some of you may remember <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-system-puppet" target="_blank" rel="external">rspec-system-puppet</a> was previously used to accomplish this, well PuppetLabs has since deprecated that in favour of Beaker but the premise is very much the same.</p>
<p>Using rspec-puppet for unit testing your manifests really only goes so far. If you’re just using the standard Puppet resources then it pretty safe to assume that it does what it says on the tin (I mean PuppetLabs really test their stuff!) but as soon as you start doing things that are a little more complex, using exec statements, custom facts, custom functions or targeting multiple operating systems then you’re really going to want to make sure that once the catalogs compile that they are doing what they are meant to be doing and this is where your acceptance test suite will come in.</p>
<p>With Beaker you can spin up a virtual machine, install modules, apply a manifest and then test what really happened.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/04/04/forgefriday-our-commitment-to-the-puppet-forge/"><h2 class="post-title">ForgeFriday - our commitment to the Puppet Forge</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 4 April 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/OSS/" class="tag post-meta">OSS</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Open-souce/" class="tag post-meta">Open souce</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Those of you that read this blog on a regular basis will be aware that here at OpenTable we take our commitment to Open Source very seriously.

<p>As part of that commitment we are trying to release all our Puppet configuration. The key to maintaining any good habit is to do little and often and with that in mind we wanted to let you know about ForgeFriday.</p>
<p>Every Friday we will be releasing our Puppet code onto the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">PuppetLabs Forge</a> (until we run out of modules). That means all our Windows modules, all our forks, our experiments, our custom facts and functions - anything and everything will start rolling out on Fridays. </p>
<p>It’s not just forge and forget either, we will continue to support all of our modules and those that use them. We will blog about some of the bigger, more important ones and continue to engage with the community as much as possible.

It can be taken for granted and tacked on using nasty query string values. But thankfully HTTP provides us with a solid gold opportunity. If you can look past the mire of content negotiation you can see the nuggets that lie inside.</p>
<p>The accept-language header is used by most browsers and allows websites to serve content in a language that the user can (hopefully) understand. When we expose content from an api (in most of our use cases, at least), this content eventually ends up in front of a human (in some shape or form). Having our service-service communication serve localised resources can be invaluable because it frees the clients from having to think about i18n of the resources being served from our api.</p>
<p>It is a simple part of the HTTP specification and is widely used and supported.</p>

Performance testing in production is enough to make some operations guys have a panic attack and a few odd looks were dished my way when I raised it on behalf of the team.</p>
<h2 id="Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment"><a href="#Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment" class="headerlink" title="Why not have a dedicated environment?"></a>Why not have a dedicated environment?</h2><p>If you can have a dedicated environment that you can build to be EXACTLY the same as where you are going to really need the performance (i.e. your production environment most likely, but possibly on a client machine) then do it in a dedicated, duplicated environment. Alternatively if there is no way you can use the production environment or your model means that everything will scale exactly like production, then a duplicate environment might work.</p>
<p>For us, we had too many dependencies, mocking these out wasn’t really satisfactory and frankly, as a business where we are quiet at night, it is easy to use the production environment at these times. We use configuration management and virtual machines, much of what should help build a replica environment, but we also have machines in restaurants around the globe. That is not easy to replicate and not worth the effort.</p>
