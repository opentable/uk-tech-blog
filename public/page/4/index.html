<p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests">a recent post</a>, I espoused some of the benefits my team enjoyed by reducing our test-base to a single layer of acceptance tests, with no separate unit or integration tests. It caused <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/" target="_blank" rel="external">some minor controversy</a>, which was not to be unexpected. At the time, I knew I had left out some details for brevity’s sake. In this post—spurred on by some interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGloyn/status/456756552092098561" target="_blank" rel="external">questions</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/cgujuv7" target="_blank" rel="external">commentary</a>—I’d like to offer a more constructive view on the subject, and dig a little deeper into the nitty gritty of how we made it work.</p>
<p>I’ll also point out some other hidden benefits of moving to acceptance-only testing, and suggest synergistic practices that can help decide if this is the right approach for your project.</p>
<h2 id="Seams"><a href="#Seams" class="headerlink" title="Seams"></a>Seams</h2><p>After-the-fact unit testing requires us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w" target="_blank" rel="external">find the seams</a> along which code can be isolated and tested. Where those seams don’t exist,  the temptation is to refactor code until they do, using patterns like <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html" target="_blank" rel="external">dependency injection</a>, and following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank" rel="external">SRP</a> and other <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod" target="_blank" rel="external">SOLID</a> patterns.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank" rel="external">Test-first unit testing</a> aka TDD naturally tends to maximise seams, and results in highly decoupled code with small, specific tests. TDD must result in 100% unit test coverage, if practiced according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-Driven_Development_by_Example" target="_blank" rel="external">the gospel</a>. In other words, TDD results in the best kind of code for later <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring" target="_blank" rel="external">modification without risk</a>, and the best tests for detailed, granular feedback. Unit tests also tend to run very quickly, sometimes fast enough to <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/05/07/configure-your-ide-to-run-your-tests-automatically/" target="_blank" rel="external">run every time you hit “Save”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance testing has far fewer seams available.</strong> Typically only one: the application boundary. Yes: <em>Your tests must invoke the entire application each time they are run.</em> Thus running acceptance tests is potentially very slow for even moderately sized projects with few dependencies—let alone large ones with many. Another problem is that, when an acceptance test fails, the failure could be at <em>any</em> layer in the stack. You immediately lose the pinpoint specificity afforded by unit tests.</p>
<p>Why, then, is it sometimes a good idea to forgo unit- in favour of acceptance-tests?</p>
<p>As we will see, the first issue, performance, can be mitigated. The second, granularity, is more difficult to overcome. But sometimes <em>that might be okay.</em></p>

Hubot is central to this and we wrote a small script to kick off deployments within <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hipchat</a></p>

<p>We have two TeamCity instances. The first is used as a build and deployment system to our pre-production servers. The second is used as a deployment system to our production servers. Artifacts from our non-production instance are stored in <a href="http://www.jfrog.com/home/v_artifactory_opensource_overview" target="_blank" rel="external">Artifactory</a> and our production deployment makes an API call to non-production TeamCity to ask for the last successfully pinned build. Pinning a build only occurs when we’re happy that the build is ready to be shipped (passing unit and acceptance tests). The above Hubot command will pin the non-production build, given that the build succeeded, and add a build to the queue in production. </p>
<p>To configure Hubot to do this we wrote a command to setup aliases providing the build id of the build to pin (non-production) and the build id of the build to kick off (production).</p>

We have since released a Puppet module that will do this for us. We originally wrote PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code>Import-Module ServerManager
Add-WindowsFeature Web-Asp-Net
</code></pre><p>The Puppet module now wraps this code as follows:</p>
<pre><code>windowsfeature { &apos;Web-Asp-Net&apos;: }
</code></pre><p>The declaration windowsfeature is a specific Puppet type called a <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/definedtypes.html" target="_blank" rel="external">define</a>. In developer terms, this is the equivalent of a helper method that can be reused. We can also make sure that Windows Features are <em>not</em> installed on the server as follows:</p>
<pre><code>windowsfeature { &apos;Telnet-Server&apos;: 
  ensure =&gt; absent 
}
</code></pre><p>In the backing code for the module, we do a check before we install / uninstall any windows features. This means that we will only make the changes we really need to. This ensures idempotency of the script. By using this class, we can build up a list of what features a server should have enabled / installed on it. As example manifest would look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>class my_windows_features {
  windowsfeature { &apos;Web-Asp-Net&apos;: }
  windowsfeature { &apos;Web-Net-Ext&apos;: }
  windowsfeature { &apos;Web-ISAPI-Ext&apos;: }
  windowsfeature { &apos;Web-ISAPI-Filter&apos;: }
  windowsfeature { &apos;Web-Mgmt-Tools&apos;: }
  windowsfeature { &apos;Web-Mgmt-Console&apos;: }
  windowsfeature { &apos;Telnet-Server&apos;: ensure =&gt; absent }
}
</code></pre><p>The server will have it’s shipping list of Windows Features checked every 30 minutes by Puppet. We are sure that any changes encountered during that time will be applied as expected.  You can find more about our WindowsFeature module on the <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-windowsfeature" target="_blank" rel="external">github repo</a>. If you want to use the module, then you can install it using the Puppet Module tool via the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature" target="_blank" rel="external">Puppet Forge</a></p>

This included our application configuration stack. IIS management is pretty easy with PowerShell. It would look something like this</p>
<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebSite -Name &quot;DemoSite&quot; -Port 80 -IP * -PhysicalPath &quot;c:\inetpub\wwwroot&quot; -ApplicationPool &quot;MyAppPool&quot;
</code></pre><p>This would of course set up a website called ‘DemoSite’ running on port 80 on the local machine. The cmdlets that come with PowerShell make this pretty easy. This is great if it is a one-off job to set up a site. We run our websites from a number of webservers, therefore, it would be silly to have to RDP into each webserver and run a script on it. This is why tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc. exist. We needed a configuration management tool to do this work for us. It has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orchestration</li>
<li>Idempotency</li>
<li>Makes sure that each server is configured in ‘exactly’ the same way as no human intervention is needed</li>
<li>Developers can help the operations team by creating the scripts needed. This is great for collaboration between teams</li>
</ul>
<p>On investigating how we would do this with Puppet, we noticed that there were not many other people managing their site in this way. Therefore, we would have to turn our PowerShell scripts into Puppet modules to manage our system. </p>
<p>We have since created a Puppet module to manage IIS. To manage IIS with Puppet, we can now write the following code:</p>
<pre><code>iis::manage_site { &apos;DemoSite:
   site_path     =&gt; &apos;c:\inetpub\wwwroot&apos;,
   port          =&gt; &apos;80&apos;,
   ip_address    =&gt; &apos;*&apos;,
   app_pool      =&gt; &apos;MyAppPool&apos;
}
</code></pre><p>This would produce <strong>exactly</strong> the same results as the code from above. But it has 1 difference. There are checks in the code behind this module that will mean the code will only execute when it is needed, i.e. when the site_path isn’t correct or the app_pool isn’t correct. This is idempotency. The script can be run again and again and again….</p>
<p>To create an application binding, we used to do this in PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebBinding -Name &apos;DemoSite&apos; -Port &apos;8080&apos; -IPAddress &apos;*&apos;

Let me share our remote working setup and some rationale for our choices. I will shy away from judging how it’s all worked out and leave that for subsequent blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="The-deal"><a href="#The-deal" class="headerlink" title="The deal"></a>The deal</h2><p>I started as an on-site engineer and subsequently became a remote worker and my challenge was to make remote working as similar to on-site working as possible. Thus it is natural that <strong>I work the same working hours</strong> as my colleagues in the office (despite the time difference) and I take <strong>public holidays</strong> at the same time that there are bank holidays in UK (even though in Poland they are different).</p>
<p>We also decided that every two months I will <strong>visit the office for a week</strong> as well as arranging visits to coincide with other office guests (like contractors, overseas colleagues and so on). All this is to try to keep me as close to the team as possible and disrupt the normal work-flow as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="The-workplace-setup"><a href="#The-workplace-setup" class="headerlink" title="The workplace setup"></a>The workplace setup</h2><p>Once home in Poland I had to carefully consider my options for a workplace. I tried three obvious possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dining room in my own one bedroom flat</li>
<li>Co-working space</li>
<li>Private room in my parents’ house</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>dining room</strong> worked pretty well, for a time…  I would ‘arrive’ really early in the office (just after taking a shower), and then be ‘home’ straight after the laptop lid was closed. My wife kindly respected that I am focused at work and distracted me only to share lunch (or to kick me out of house to bring the lunch in).</p>
<p>A couple of things made it only a short-term solution - the first being my back complaining about working on a chair that’s nice for a dinner, but awful for working on computer. Then I realised that I really miss a second monitor and separate keyboard &ndash; I guess anybody who coded in the middle of summer on a laptop knows the pain of a hot computer under your fingers.  Finally, my child was born, and that was it &ndash; a crying child in the same room when you are trying to pair with somebody is a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>In the meantime I evaluated a local <strong>co-working space</strong>. The problem was that it was quiet, <em>really quiet</em>, up to the point that I was embarrassed to pair with somebody remotely. The way we work fluctuates over time; there are weeks when I do stuff alone and in silence, there are weeks when I spend whole days on conversations or pairing. I just cannot be too quiet. For that matter I tried also a coffee shop, but it failed me for exactly the same reasons as the dining room table.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/29/remote-worker-notes-tools-and-setup/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/04/28/effective-prioritisation/"><h2 class="post-title">Effective prioritisation</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 28 April 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Leadership/" class="tag post-meta">Leadership</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Coaching/" class="tag post-meta">Coaching</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Work-smarter/" class="tag post-meta">Work smarter</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Culture/" class="tag post-meta">Culture</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Prioritisation is a huge part of modern life.</p>

<p>How do we know what to do next? Perhaps you lean on your gut feeling to order your to-do list. Maybe it is real-time cost and budget implications that influence your priorities or does it come down to who shouts loudest?</p>

Increasingly this has been more accurately redefined as the Information Age. </p>
<p>The society we live in today truly bombardes us with information. Whether it be TV, mobile, emails, blog posts, status updates, tweets, likes and check-in’s we are rarely unconnected to modern day life and have a vast amount of data and information at our disposal.</p>
<p>This flood of information leads to a problem: we often confuse the importance of everyday tasks and activities. </p>
<p>For instance how many times have we said “I don’t have time to read” or “I’d love to be able to go to the gym more”. Perhaps a more honest way to say this is “reading is not a high priority for me” or “I prioritise other activities higher than going to the gym”. </p></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/28/effective-prioritisation/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests/"><h2 class="post-title">Look ma, no unit tests!</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 16 April 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Engineering/" class="tag post-meta">Engineering</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Testing/" class="tag post-meta">Testing</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Acceptance-tests/" class="tag post-meta">Acceptance tests</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Innovation/" class="tag post-meta">Innovation</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve written a <a href="/blog/2014/05/19/acceptance-now">follow-up to this post</a> with a bit more detail into how we made acceptance-only testing work in practice.</em></p>
<p>At OpenTable we strive to deliver change as quickly and correctly as possible. To do this effectively we are always looking for <a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/">new</a> <a href="/blog/2013/08/16/grunt-plus-vagrant-equals-acceptance-test-heaven/">tools</a> <a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/">and</a> <a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/">methods</a> that allow us, the developers, to respond quickly and accurately to changing requirements and environments.</p>
<p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I’ve ever worked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>We operate in small teams who each own <em>most</em> of their own vertical.</li>
<li>We use continuous delivery to ship code to production within minutes.</li>
<li>We have a high degree of high-quality test coverage.</li>
<li>We are getting better and better at monitoring All The Things.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/">We use Chatops</a>, so communication is central to our work, and keeps remote workers/teams in the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above are truly empowering for the dev team, and are conducive to an amazingly stress-free working environment. However, these practices only address the infrastructure, culture, and ceremony surrounding our work. What if there was something else? Something about the way we write the code itself, that could increase our velocity yet further, without compromising our integrity…</p>

<p>Well, on a recent project, we found one such way: <em><em>we decided to delete all of the unit and integration tests</em></em>.</p>
<p><em>What?! Are we quite mad?</em> You may be thinking… Well, it took me a little time to get used to this idea as well, but read on and you’ll see that it was actually the most sane thing we could have possibly done    .</p>

<p>This should be a very straightforward task to complete because this is one of the core resources that Puppet manages - the upgrading of packages. With that in mind, putting <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> in one of our base profiles would be all that was needed but alas it was not. In this blog I want to take you through the history, the bugs, the platforms and the edge-cases that make performing an in-place upgrade of Puppet a more complex task that it ought to be.</p>
<h2 id="Debian"><a href="#Debian" class="headerlink" title="Debian"></a>Debian</h2><p>Like many, Ubuntu is our Debian derivative of choice for much of our newer production infrastructure. Debian, has the apt package management system and PuppetLabs provide the required deb packages as well as hosting their own apt repository to point our systems to. The main point of package management systems is that they take care of the dependency hell and the awkward upgrade paths all from within the confines of the package itself, and that is what happens with the PuppetLabs packages - great. </p>
<p>The problem that we had in some of our systems was that they had been built without the PuppetLabs apt repository. This means that they picked up a slightly older version of the Puppet packages from the main Ubuntu distribution repositories and didn’t have access to the newer versions of the Puppet packages. Ok, so we solved that with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>exec { &apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;:
  path    =&gt; &apos;/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin&apos;,
  command =&gt; &apos;sed -i \&apos;s:deb\ http\:\/\/apt.puppetlabs.com\/ precise main::\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
  onlyif  =&gt; &apos;grep \&apos;deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ precise main\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
}

apt::source { &apos;puppetlabs&apos;:
  location    =&gt; &apos;http://apt.puppetlabs.com&apos;,
  repos       =&gt; &apos;main dependencies&apos;,
  key         =&gt; &apos;4BD6EC30&apos;,
  key_content =&gt; template(&apos;puppetversion/puppetlabs.gpg&apos;),
  require     =&gt; Exec[&apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;]
}
</code></pre><p>We’re making use of the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt" target="_blank" rel="external">puppetlabs/apt</a> module here. This removes the old reference and adding in the new apt source. Then we just add the package and ensure the version we’re upgrading. Perfect.</p>
<h2 id="RedHat"><a href="#RedHat" class="headerlink" title="RedHat"></a>RedHat</h2><p>Same problem different OS family - this time we had some older CentOS machines that needed fixing. Thankfully there is also a module <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/stahnma/puppetlabs_yum" target="_blank" rel="external">stahnma/puppetlabs_yum</a> for the yum repositories. Add that in, add the package resource and start upgrading. Phew! This seems like it’s getting easier.</p>

Not a contrived example but a real-world need as we begin to move our infrastructure from Windows to Linux. Managing users is one of those tasks that is at the core of the Puppet ecosystem and I thought this would be pretty easy as I had done this sort of thing many times before. What added to the complexity was that we needed to support Ubuntu, Centos and FreeBSD machines that we had in our stack and we wanted to make it something that was open source and on the Forge - so lots of testing was required.</p>
<p>This was not the first module that I had written for the Forge but it was the first that I had written since PuppetLabs had introduced their new acceptance testing framework <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker" target="_blank" rel="external">Beaker</a> and so I wanted to spend some time getting the module working with this new tool.</p>
<h2 id="Beaker"><a href="#Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Beaker"></a>Beaker</h2><p>The purpose of Beaker is to allow you to write acceptance tests for your modules, that is to write some manifests that use your module and test them out on a virtual machine. Some of you may remember <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-system-puppet" target="_blank" rel="external">rspec-system-puppet</a> was previously used to accomplish this, well PuppetLabs has since deprecated that in favour of Beaker but the premise is very much the same.</p>
<p>Using rspec-puppet for unit testing your manifests really only goes so far. If you’re just using the standard Puppet resources then it pretty safe to assume that it does what it says on the tin (I mean PuppetLabs really test their stuff!) but as soon as you start doing things that are a little more complex, using exec statements, custom facts, custom functions or targeting multiple operating systems then you’re really going to want to make sure that once the catalogs compile that they are doing what they are meant to be doing and this is where your acceptance test suite will come in.</p>
<p>With Beaker you can spin up a virtual machine, install modules, apply a manifest and then test what really happened.</p>
<p>Beaker works with many different hypervisor technologies but most people will be using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Vagrant</a> so that is what I will cover here.</p>
<h3 id="Configuring-Beaker"><a href="#Configuring-Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Beaker"></a>Configuring Beaker</h3><p>The first thing in configuring your existing project to use Beaker is to add “beaker” and “beaker_rspec” to you Gemfile. You’re then going to want to create a new spec_helper file called spec_helper_acceptence.rb that should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>require &apos;beaker-rspec/spec_helper&apos;
require &apos;beaker-rspec/helpers/serverspec&apos;

hosts.each do |host|
  install_puppet
end

UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = [&apos;Suse&apos;,&apos;windows&apos;,&apos;AIX&apos;,&apos;Solaris&apos;]

RSpec.configure do |c|
  proj_root = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), &apos;..&apos;))

  c.formatter = :documentation

  # Configure all nodes in nodeset
  c.before :suite do
    puppet_module_install(:source =&gt; proj_root, :module_name =&gt; &apos;homes&apos;)
    hosts.each do |host|
      on host, puppet(&apos;module&apos;,&apos;install&apos;,&apos;puppetlabs-stdlib&apos;), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
      on host, puppet(&apos;module&apos;, &apos;install&apos;, &apos;opentable-altlib&apos;), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
    end
  end
end

As part of the infrastructure team at OpenTable we are begining a process of being open-first. That means that everything we write will be open-sourced unless it contains a significant amount of internal information but we will architect to limit this.</p>
<p>As part of that commitment we are trying to release all our Puppet configuration. The key to maintaining any good habit is to do little and often and with that in mind we wanted to let you know about ForgeFriday.</p>
<p>Every Friday we will be releasing our Puppet code onto the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">PuppetLabs Forge</a> (until we run out of modules). That means all our Windows modules, all our forks, our experiments, our custom facts and functions - anything and everything will start rolling out on Fridays. </p>
<p>It’s not just forge and forget either, we will continue to support all of our modules and those that use them. We will blog about some of the bigger, more important ones and continue to engage with the community as much as possible. If you’re using our modules (even if you have no issues) then let us know - we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>In the meantime go and check out what we have already released:</p>
<p><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/windowsfeature</a> - Module that will turn Windows features on or off<br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis_rewrite" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/iis_rewrite</a> - Module that will install the IIS Rewrite 2.0 Module on Windows <br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/remaster" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/remaster</a> - Module for managing the remaster of agent nodes <br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/puppetversion" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/puppetversion</a> - Module for managing the installation and upgrade of Puppet<br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/altlib" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/altlib</a> - Module providing some additional useful functions <br></p>
