<p>At OpenTable we strive to deliver change as quickly and correctly as possible. To do this effectively we are always looking for <a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/">new</a> <a href="/blog/2013/08/16/grunt-plus-vagrant-equals-acceptance-test-heaven/">tools</a> <a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/">and</a> <a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/">methods</a> that allow us, the developers, to respond quickly and accurately to changing requirements and environments.</p>
<p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I’ve ever worked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>We operate in small teams who each own <em>most</em> of their own vertical.</li>
<li>We use continuous delivery to ship code to production within minutes.</li>
<li>We have a high degree of high-quality test coverage.</li>
<li>We are getting better and better at monitoring All The Things.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/">We use Chatops</a>, so communication is central to our work, and keeps remote workers/teams in the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above are truly empowering for the dev team, and are conducive to an amazingly stress-free working environment. However, these practices only address the infrastructure, culture, and ceremony surrounding our work. What if there was something else? Something about the way we write the code itself, that could increase our velocity yet further, without compromising our integrity…</p>

<p>Well, on a recent project, we found one such way: <em><em>we decided to delete all of the unit and integration tests</em></em>.</p>
<p><em>What?! Are we quite mad?</em> You may be thinking… Well, it took me a little time to get used to this idea as well, but read on and you’ll see that it was actually the most sane thing we could have possibly done    .</p>

<p>This should be a very straightforward task to complete because this is one of the core resources that Puppet manages - the upgrading of packages. With that in mind, putting <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> in one of our base profiles would be all that was needed but alas it was not. In this blog I want to take you through the history, the bugs, the platforms and the edge-cases that make performing an in-place upgrade of Puppet a more complex task that it ought to be.</p>
<p>##Debian<br>Like many, Ubuntu is our Debian derivative of choice for much of our newer production infrastructure. Debian, has the apt package management system and PuppetLabs provide the required deb packages as well as hosting their own apt repository to point our systems to. The main point of package management systems is that they take care of the dependency hell and the awkward upgrade paths all from within the confines of the package itself, and that is what happens with the PuppetLabs packages - great. </p>
<p>The problem that we had in some of our systems was that they had been built without the PuppetLabs apt repository. This means that they picked up a slightly older version of the Puppet packages from the main Ubuntu distribution repositories and didn’t have access to the newer versions of the Puppet packages. Ok, so we solved that with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>exec { &apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;:
  path    =&gt; &apos;/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin&apos;,
  command =&gt; &apos;sed -i \&apos;s:deb\ http\:\/\/apt.puppetlabs.com\/ precise main::\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
  onlyif  =&gt; &apos;grep \&apos;deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ precise main\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
}

apt::source { &apos;puppetlabs&apos;:
  location    =&gt; &apos;http://apt.puppetlabs.com&apos;,
  repos       =&gt; &apos;main dependencies&apos;,
  key         =&gt; &apos;4BD6EC30&apos;,
  key_content =&gt; template(&apos;puppetversion/puppetlabs.gpg&apos;),
  require     =&gt; Exec[&apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;]
}
</code></pre><p>We’re making use of the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt" target="_blank" rel="external">puppetlabs/apt</a> module here. This removes the old reference and adding in the new apt source. Then we just add the package and ensure the version we’re upgrading. Perfect.</p>
<p>##RedHat</p>
<p>Same problem different OS family - this time we had some older CentOS machines that needed fixing. Thankfully there is also a module <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/stahnma/puppetlabs_yum" target="_blank" rel="external">stahnma/puppetlabs_yum</a> for the yum repositories. Add that in, add the package resource and start upgrading. Phew! This seems like it’s getting easier.</p>
<p>##Windows</p>
<p>Many of you will be following the work of OpenTable closely because of our work with Puppet on Windows. We have a pretty large Windows infrastructure, with a wide range of client and server versions deployed ranging from 2012 R2 all the way back to the historic times of 2003. Windows also has its own package format, the msi, and PuppetLabs also provides all versions of Puppet packaged as msi files. </p></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 4 April 2014</p><div class="post-entry"><p>One afternoon I got asked to write a new Puppet module to manage local users on our Linux boxes. Not a contrived example but a real-world need as we begin to move our infrastructure from Windows to Linux. Managing users is one of those tasks that is at the core of the Puppet ecosystem and I thought this would be pretty easy as I had done this sort of thing many times before. What added to the complexity was that we needed to support Ubuntu, Centos and FreeBSD machines that we had in our stack and we wanted to make it something that was open source and on the Forge - so lots of testing was required.</p>
<p>This was not the first module that I had written for the Forge but it was the first that I had written since PuppetLabs had introduced their new acceptance testing framework <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker" target="_blank" rel="external">Beaker</a> and so I wanted to spend some time getting the module working with this new tool.</p>
<h2 id="Beaker"><a href="#Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Beaker"></a>Beaker</h2><p>The purpose of Beaker is to allow you to write acceptance tests for your modules, that is to write some manifests that use your module and test them out on a virtual machine. Some of you may remember <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-system-puppet" target="_blank" rel="external">rspec-system-puppet</a> was previously used to accomplish this, well PuppetLabs has since deprecated that in favour of Beaker but the premise is very much the same.</p>
<p>Using rspec-puppet for unit testing your manifests really only goes so far. If you’re just using the standard Puppet resources then it pretty safe to assume that it does what it says on the tin (I mean PuppetLabs really test their stuff!) but as soon as you start doing things that are a little more complex, using exec statements, custom facts, custom functions or targeting multiple operating systems then you’re really going to want to make sure that once the catalogs compile that they are doing what they are meant to be doing and this is where your acceptance test suite will come in.</p>
<p>With Beaker you can spin up a virtual machine, install modules, apply a manifest and then test what really happened.</p>
<p>Beaker works with many different hypervisor technologies but most people will be using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Vagrant</a> so that is what I will cover here.</p>
<h3 id="Configuring-Beaker"><a href="#Configuring-Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Beaker"></a>Configuring Beaker</h3><p>The first thing in configuring your existing project to use Beaker is to add “beaker” and “beaker_rspec” to you Gemfile. You’re then going to want to create a new spec_helper file called spec_helper_acceptence.rb that should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>require &apos;beaker-rspec/spec_helper&apos;
require &apos;beaker-rspec/helpers/serverspec&apos;

hosts.each do |host|
  install_puppet
end

UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = [&apos;Suse&apos;,&apos;windows&apos;,&apos;AIX&apos;,&apos;Solaris&apos;]

RSpec.configure do |c|
  proj_root = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), &apos;..&apos;))

  c.formatter = :documentation

  # Configure all nodes in nodeset
  c.before :suite do
    puppet_module_install(:source =&gt; proj_root, :module_name =&gt; &apos;homes&apos;)
    hosts.each do |host|
      on host, puppet(&apos;module&apos;,&apos;install&apos;,&apos;puppetlabs-stdlib&apos;), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
      on host, puppet(&apos;module&apos;, &apos;install&apos;, &apos;opentable-altlib&apos;), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
    end
  end
end

As part of the infrastructure team at OpenTable we are begining a process of being open-first. That means that everything we write will be open-sourced unless it contains a significant amount of internal information but we will architect to limit this.</p>
<p>As part of that commitment we are trying to release all our Puppet configuration. The key to maintaining any good habit is to do little and often and with that in mind we wanted to let you know about ForgeFriday.</p>
<p>Every Friday we will be releasing our Puppet code onto the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">PuppetLabs Forge</a> (until we run out of modules). That means all our Windows modules, all our forks, our experiments, our custom facts and functions - anything and everything will start rolling out on Fridays. </p>
<p>It’s not just forge and forget either, we will continue to support all of our modules and those that use them. We will blog about some of the bigger, more important ones and continue to engage with the community as much as possible. If you’re using our modules (even if you have no issues) then let us know - we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>In the meantime go and check out what we have already released:</p>
<p><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/windowsfeature</a> - Module that will turn Windows features on or off<br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis_rewrite" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/iis_rewrite</a> - Module that will install the IIS Rewrite 2.0 Module on Windows <br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/remaster" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/remaster</a> - Module for managing the remaster of agent nodes <br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/puppetversion" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/puppetversion</a> - Module for managing the installation and upgrade of Puppet<br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/altlib" target="_blank" rel="external">opentable/altlib</a> - Module providing some additional useful functions <br></p>

It can be taken for granted and tacked on using nasty query string values. But thankfully HTTP provides us with a solid gold opportunity. If you can look past the mire of content negotiation you can see the nuggets that lie inside.</p>
<p>The accept-language header is used by most browsers and allows websites to serve content in a language that the user can (hopefully) understand. When we expose content from an api (in most of our use cases, at least), this content eventually ends up in front of a human (in some shape or form). Having our service-service communication serve localised resources can be invaluable because it frees the clients from having to think about i18n of the resources being served from our api.</p>
<p>It is a simple part of the HTTP specification and is widely used and supported.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">GET /product/123</div><div class="line">Accept-Language: en-US</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The accept-language header is specifically designed to allow the server to provide a representation of the resource which approximates something the client can understand.</p>
<p>The really useful bit comes from the quality value. </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">GET /product/123</div><div class="line">Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This header asks the service to provide en-US, and if it’s unavailable then fall back to <strong>any</strong> english representation. The quality value (<code>q=0.8</code>) is a decimal value between 0 and 1 which indicates order of preference when specifying multiple languages. The server should pick the <strong>first</strong> available match. If there are multiple matches with the same quality value, then the server can pick any. If the client wants to specify some fierce preferences then they can crank out something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">GET /product/123</div><div class="line">Accept-Language: fr-CA,fr-FR;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6,en-US;q=0.4,en;q=0.2,*;q=0.1</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>If you decipher this it’s pretty simple, you can see the quality headers giving the order in which the languages are preferred. What it does is give the client fantastic flexibility. For service-service communication you might have a use-case which will <em>never</em> serve a representation that doesn’t match the request, or you might need to <em>always</em> provide some representation (i.e. for cases where some content is always better than none).</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/02/internationalisation-in-a-restful-world/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/03/20/when-to-performance-test-in-production/"><h2 class="post-title">When to performance test in production</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 20 March 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Performance/" class="tag post-meta">Performance</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/">my last post</a> about performance testing I wrote about how we decided to do it in production as the ultimate test of success. Performance testing in production is enough to make some operations guys have a panic attack and a few odd looks were dished my way when I raised it on behalf of the team.</p>
<h2 id="Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment"><a href="#Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment" class="headerlink" title="Why not have a dedicated environment?"></a>Why not have a dedicated environment?</h2><p>If you can have a dedicated environment that you can build to be EXACTLY the same as where you are going to really need the performance (i.e. your production environment most likely, but possibly on a client machine) then do it in a dedicated, duplicated environment. Alternatively if there is no way you can use the production environment or your model means that everything will scale exactly like production, then a duplicate environment might work.</p>
<p>For us, we had too many dependencies, mocking these out wasn’t really satisfactory and frankly, as a business where we are quiet at night, it is easy to use the production environment at these times. We use configuration management and virtual machines, much of what should help build a replica environment, but we also have machines in restaurants around the globe. That is not easy to replicate and not worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="Even-if-you-can-have-a-duplicated-environment-should-you"><a href="#Even-if-you-can-have-a-duplicated-environment-should-you" class="headerlink" title="Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?"></a>Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?</h2><p>We felt in the search team that we just wouldn’t uncover a broken server (that can affect performance) or we wouldn’t see that we had a problem with interactions with these services (we have now got to serialisation as our bottleneck, maybe we would have missed that).</p>
<p>We just didn’t trust that a duplicated environment would actually help us in this case. If you want to test a new idea as a prototype then the duplicate will probably work, even if just at first, we were trying to improve our actual environment.</p>
<h2 id="Is-testing-in-production-right"><a href="#Is-testing-in-production-right" class="headerlink" title="Is testing in production right?"></a>Is testing in production right?</h2><p>There is no ‘right’ answer here, plenty of people test in a duplicate environment and then monitor in production. I think this is probably a valid approach and in a lot of use cases this would be fine for us too.</p>
<p>Can you micro-optimise in a huge production system?  Probably not, so use a scaled down duplicate for that or even a local environment such as one created using Vagrant. Hopefully with enough micro-optimisations you will eventually see these in a larger environment.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/03/20/when-to-performance-test-in-production/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/"><h2 class="post-title">Performance testing our Search API</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 19 March 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/REST/" class="tag post-meta">REST</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/API/" class="tag post-meta">API</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Benchmarks/" class="tag post-meta">Benchmarks</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Performance/" class="tag post-meta">Performance</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>It was midnight on the Friday before Christmas, my seven-week old child was tucked up asleep and I was pretty chilled. All was calm and it was time for bed. Two minutes later I had a phone call, followed by a series of Nagios email alerts, and a need to put my work hat on quickly. The search API was having trouble; as the manager of the team who developed it, I was not looking forward to this. We were having a real slowdown at one of our busiest times of the year &ndash; this was going to be fun.</p>
<p>Once the dust settled and we were back up and running we realised we needed to do a better job of performance testing and actually solve any performance issues. We <em>had</em> done some performance testing but clearly not the right kind.</p>
<h2 id="What-had-gone-wrong"><a href="#What-had-gone-wrong" class="headerlink" title="What had gone wrong?"></a>What had gone wrong?</h2><p>We were indexing our data too frequently, and under load it started to take a long time. We created a race condition where multiple indexing operations started happening. As each operation assumed the previous one had either failed or finished a vicious circle occurred making the situation worse and worse.</p>
<p>The simple fix was just to index the data less often or not at all if another operation was running, however we wanted to get to the bottom of why we slowed down under load which exposed this race condition, improve that speed and understand what is the maximum load the system can take.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-a-benchmark"><a href="#Getting-a-benchmark" class="headerlink" title="Getting a benchmark"></a>Getting a benchmark</h2><p>In order to know if we were actually making improvements we needed to be able to recreate load and see the impact. In order to do this and truly appreciate how it was going we needed to use our live environment &ndash; the only environment I felt we could truly understand. My next post will explain why we felt this was the best environment for the job.</p>
<p>With search and availability it is actually quite hard to use response times as a benchmark and the name of this exercise was really to cope with greater load. Response times are still nice to improve though so we were tracking them, but not using them as our main benchmark.</p>
<h2 id="Some-perspective-on-our-problem-domain"><a href="#Some-perspective-on-our-problem-domain" class="headerlink" title="Some perspective on our problem domain"></a>Some perspective on our problem domain</h2><p>We do not have a large index, in the tens of thousands of restaurants rather than millions of tweets for example. We have to merge in table availability (the fantastic thing about the OpenTable system) to the more static restaurant information. We also have large page sizes, needing to get up to 2,500 results out of one Elastic Search request. This proved to be relevant.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/"><h2 class="post-title">Benchmarking APIs - why it’s important, and how</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 28 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/REST/" class="tag post-meta">REST</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/API/" class="tag post-meta">API</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Benchmarks/" class="tag post-meta">Benchmarks</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/SOA/" class="tag post-meta">SOA</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Node-js/" class="tag post-meta">Node.js</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Performance/" class="tag post-meta">Performance</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Continuous-delivery/" class="tag post-meta">Continuous delivery</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Since I joined OpenTable I’ve been experimenting with performance monitoring, specifically on web services.

After seeing the results I thought that something was going wrong:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">.NET/route1 x 9.16 ops/sec ±12.71% (17 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">nodeJS/route1 x 106 ops/sec ±1.19% (180 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">======================================</div><div class="line">Fastest is nodeJS/route1</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">.NET/route2 x 10.70 ops/sec ±8.54% (19 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">nodeJS/route2 x 118 ops/sec ±1.22% (175 runs sampled)</div><div class="line">======================================</div><div class="line">Fastest is nodeJS/route2</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">======================================</div><div class="line">Fastest Service is nodeJS</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>After trying to microbenchmark different layers of the software, I found the problem. On the .NET side I was reading a file synchronously, for every request; the file system’s library used with the node.js app, instead, was automatically caching the reads as default. After setting up a basic caching mechanism in the .NET app and running my script again the node.js API was only 1.4 times faster. After finding and solving that issue I thought how badly the application could have handled concurrency when deployed in production, even if it was heavily unit tested, the specs were well defined, and it was built using all the best techniques we all love.</p>
<p>As developers we rely on technologies that, with a minimum effort, can guarantee some pretty decent results in terms of performance. Modern web frameworks handle concurrency and thread management without requiring much plumbing code. Sophisticated and relatively cheap cloud services help us monitor our applications, providing dashboards, reports and alerting systems. Deploying on the cloud we can run our services and even auto-scale them depending on how much power we need. Even with these tools we must still own the responsibility of writing good quality code, testing it properly, and deploying as fast as possible in order to optimise the delivery process of our products. </p>
<p>But what about performance? I mean, what about the relationship between the code we write every day, and the way we impact overall performance? Are we sure that we are not deploying to production something that is degrading our services’ performance?</p>
<h2 id="The-how"><a href="#The-how" class="headerlink" title="The how"></a>The how</h2><p>Talking about the ‘why’ could be relatively easy, but the ‘how’ is a controversial topic. In my experience there are three important steps to any dish. First, we need the right tools to manipulate the ingredients. I tried many different tools but I couldn’t find a good fit for all my benchmarking requirements. It always makes sense to start with something to get you going but after a while it is important to find what’s the best for you, your team, and your project.</p>
<p>Then, you start cooking: personally, the number of things I’ve learned by just starting to benchmark some services is incredible. Nevertheless, as with every time we talk about metrics, it is key to know what is important about the data we are analysing, recognise the false positives/negatives and be aware of vanity metrics that could emphasize something irrelevant, or, more importantly, hide something significant.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management/"><h2 class="post-title">Programme Management, making Agile scale</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 12 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Leadership/" class="tag post-meta">Leadership</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Agile/" class="tag post-meta">Agile</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="Popular-topic-at-conferences"><a href="#Popular-topic-at-conferences" class="headerlink" title="Popular topic at conferences"></a>Popular topic at conferences</h2><p>A lot of us were lucky enough to attend NDC London this year, we even sponsored one of the food stalls. I often see one or more real themes coming from talks at conferences. At NDC London I saw three talks around scaling Agile. Indeed Dan North’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod" target="_blank" rel="external">@tastapod</a>) talk was called exactly that. It is a topic OpenTable is trying to make happen. We are about 100 engineers on three continents which is a lot of teams working together.</p>
<p>I truly believe that the only way to make an individual team successful in an Agile environment is to have ownership of an area, a system or similar. That enables fast feedback, quick decision making and also a sense of pride and responsibility for what people are working on.</p>
<p>However, when you have a big project, you can’t give it to just one team. You need many teams working together. You can split it up and get teams to work on the parts of the project affecting the code they own. This will though mean certain parts of the project go faster than others, and if teams are autonomous, who is really responsible for bringing all those pieces together? Also, imagine you are the project owner and need to have a rough handle on when things can actually be delivered, who is going to give you that? None of the individual teams know, everyone is Agile and cool and so everyone hates estimates.</p>
<p>The point made by three speakers at NDC London, <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod" target="_blank" rel="external">Dan North</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble" target="_blank" rel="external">Jez Humble</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gojkoadzic" target="_blank" rel="external">Gojko Adzic</a> came down to the need for the coordination piece across the teams. One thing Dan North (more or less) said is <em>“if your team is really fast and all the others are slow, the project is slow and your team haven’t achieved their goal”</em>. That was not the exact words he used but the sentiment came across. </p>
<p>Indeed we have some big projects at OpenTable and as we have properly embraced Agile in many ways, we still had some pain points in this exact area. We were getting to the same conclusions but since these talks we have had some more solid programme management and in the third cross-team meeting as a result, things starting taking shape. It really is an important piece of the jigsaw.</p>
<p>I would also recommend a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILP1pJAuT9c&amp;list=PLBMFXMTB7U74NdDghygvBaDcp67owVUUF&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl" target="_blank" rel="external">DevDay talk</a> from Dariusz Dziuk on this and how Spotify make things scale. Slightly different content but a similar theme.</p>

We had teams of developers and operations. They rarely mixed. Around nine months ago we started to really try and get these teams working together. We introduced a configuration management tool, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet" target="_blank" rel="external">Puppet</a>, into our ecosystem. </p>
<p>Configuration management is one of the steps of continuous delivery that developers often forget. They feel that systems are magically created for them to deploy their application to. I used to believe this. When I was focused on developing software, I never gave any thought as to the work our operations team had to do to keep the train on the track. So give some respect to your operations teams! We created a repository and started to experiment by configuring some of our applications using Puppet. </p>
<p>This was a major step for both sets of teams. The developers started being in charge of the configuration of their application. This meant that their application would guarantee to be configured the same in our CI environment as it was in production. We, as developers, would be more confident of our applications working as expected. </p>
<p>To contribute to the project, as an engineer, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fork the project</li>
<li>make the changes you require</li>
<li>test the changes in a Vagrant environment (already created with a Windows and Linux system)</li>
<li>send a PR (pull request)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have just merged our #847 pull request. The stats of the repository look as follows:</p>
<img src="/images/posts/puppet-adoption.png" class="center">
<p>Our puppet repository has had contributions from over 40% of our engineering / operations teams. We use Puppet to manage our application servers, DHCP servers, provisioning systems and even our MS Sql Server continuous integration infrastructure. The adoption has been fantastic. We started by running our internal QA infrastructure and then scaled it out to our production infrastructure. We now manage 548 nodes (a combination of internal and production) via Puppet. </p>
<p>Using a project called <a href="www.fullybaked.co.uk/articles/getting-gource-running-on-osx">Gource</a>, one of our engineering leads, <a href="http://twitter.com/ryantomlinson" target="_blank" rel="external">Ryan Tomlinson</a>, created a video of the repository vizualization. It’s just over two minutes long and shows the activity the repository has taken.</p>
