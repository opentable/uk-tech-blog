<p>In our NeverEnding quest to provide better experience to the users we utilise user behaviour logs to influence future results. One particular case is restaurant popularity, which is indicated by many factors, for example how often it is searched and viewed.</p>
<p>In this blog post we will look into multiple ways of counting documents in Elastic Search which is crucial for this kind of activity. All examples here are provided using Elastic Search HTTP interface and code examples implemented with <a href="https://github.com/Yegoroff/PlainElastic.Net" target="_blank" rel="external">PlainElastic.NET</a> are <a href="https://gist.github.com/gondar/6320578" target="_blank" rel="external">available here</a></p>

<p>Okay, that’s not exactly how our story was defined but as we don’t want to discuss the whole search infrastructure here, let’s assume this is sufficient.</p>

<p>I’m not going to bang on about how great Vagrant is, because better people than me have already soliloquised at length on that subject. Let’s just take it as writ that <strong>Vagrant is awesome</strong>. </p>
<p>The objective is simple, we want to have a virtualised environment to run our acceptance tests against, that we can create and provision on demand, to ensure that our acceptance tests only deal with functional-correctness, not data- or environment-correctness.</p>
<p>I created a set of Grunt tasks which were able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spin up an provision a Vagrant instance</li>
<li>Deploy the project code    </li>
<li>Start the server</li>
<li>Run the acceptance tests</li>
<li>Tear it all down</li>

It lints, it configures, it minifies, it tests and it packages.</p>
<p>As we move towards getting our first node app into production, we were looking at ways to deploy it. First we thought of <a href="http://www.capistranorb.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Capistrano</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Capistrano</em></strong> is a fully featured deployment framework written in ruby and levering rake style tasks. It’s extremely powerful and very robust, plus there is a <a href="https://github.com/loopj/capistrano-node-deploy" target="_blank" rel="external">gem for node deployments</a>. Alas, it was not to be. After half a day of tail chasing and hoop jumping, it occurred to me that there must be an easier way. Capistrano was encouraging me to make my project fit their template, rather than allowing me to configure the deployment to match my project. When I dug down into the Capistrano source, I found that it was just using ssh and sftp to run remote commands and copy files. But we can simplify this process.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grunt</em></strong> has been great so far, so I started looking at deploying directly through grunt. We would be deploying to Ubuntu server boxes, so the only tools necessary are ssh and sftp.</p>
<p>There are Grunt modules for nearly <a href="https://npmjs.org/search?q=grunt" target="_blank" rel="external">everything</a> (linting, minifying, testing, waiting, packaging, shell-exec’ing, tagging, etc.), and rather predictably, sshing (with sftp).</p>

Thankfully, at the time, all the data I needed was cached in memory so building the response object was a simple set of linq queries over the cached reviews.</p>
<h2 id="The-problem"><a href="#The-problem" class="headerlink" title="The problem"></a>The problem</h2><p>Over time the number of reviews grow, and grow, and grow!  In fact it is inevitable that, in time, it will reach a point where caching all this data in memory would be madness.  One option to mitigate this would be to limit the cache to a fixed date range but this won’t work in this instance because the summary logic supports custom date ranges.  Another option would be to pull the data from the persistence store each and every time it’s required however this would seriously impact load on the infrastructure and degrade performance of the API.</p>
<p>We like to be proactive at OpenTable, so during innovation time (yes! we get time to innovate on our development) I looked at finding an alternate solution that would meet the requirements of the logic and wouldn’t drastically increase load or degrade performance.</p>
<h2 id="The-solution"><a href="#The-solution" class="headerlink" title="The solution"></a>The solution</h2><p>MongoDB supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" target="_blank" rel="external">MapReduce</a> which allows processing large volumes of data (Map), running arbitrary logic to summarise (Reduce) and producing some results.  In MongoDB the MapReduce functionality uses JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce steps and the syntax is relatively simple to understand:-</p>

This essentially means that regardless what the developers’ machine is set up or running as, they can still reproduce the same environment as their colleagues just by entering a command. </p>
<p>Configuration managgement is something we have had to embrace to help us maintain an ever changing world of technologies. The hardest thing is knowing what we actually have to build in these environments. We use Vagrant to help us understand this. The simple flow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer starts a new project</li>
<li>Developer creates a Vagrantfile to spin up a local VM</li>
<li>Vagrantfile gets iterated on as the development process goes forward</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the developer understands what they need to actually run their software, we would then go about creating an environment to which this software will actually be deployed for end-to-end testing. I won’t go any further into the details of our Vagrant flow in this post, if you want to read more about how to get started with Vagrant, then I would suggest reading <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026358.do" target="_blank" rel="external">Vagrant Up and Running</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh" target="_blank" rel="external">Mitchell Hashimoto</a>.</p>

<p>I went through the available testing frameworks for Javascript and decided on Jasmine. Why? Mainly because of its BDD syntax which is fashionable this season. The second reason is that it has really cool documentation. Finally, the basic set up of just running an HTML file in a browser got me up and running fast.</p>

There is no easy way to do it. The general way to install a certificate to a Windows Server 2008 machine is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Certificates snap-in for a user, computer, or service.</li>
<li>In the console tree, click the logical store where you want to import the certificate.</li>
<li>On the Action menu, point to All Tasks, and then click Import to start the Certificate Import Wizard.</li>
<li>Type the file name containing the certificate to be imported. </li>
<li>If you want to specify where the certificate is stored, select Place all certificates in the following store, click Browse, and choose the certificate store to use. OR</li>
<li>If the certificate should be automatically placed in a certificate store based on the type of certificate, click Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time I ran this process, I felt as though this was just wrong to not be able to automate. The goal of our team is to automate everything we are currently doing manually. PowerShell is a better option for this import process as it allows you to write code to do it. As we all know, code is better for a number of reasons, I won’t go into the infrastructure as code argument in this post (but it is coming soon….). Using PowerShell, I can write a simple function as follows:</p>
<pre><code>function Import-PfxCertificate($certName, $CertLocaton, $certRootStore, $certStore) {    
     $pfx = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2    

     $pfxPass = convertto-securestring $CertPassword -asplaintext -force

     $certPath = $CertLocaton + &quot;\&quot; + $certName   
     $pfx.import($certPath,$pfxPass,&quot;Exportable,PersistKeySet&quot;)    

     $store = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store($certStore,$certRootStore)

Being away from the team for three days in a foreign country with major project work going on at the same time was a bit uncomfortable. I was worried that the time and expense needed to be justified. That fear went away after the first night in the bar!</p>
<p>The sessions were great, many things I haven’t had a chance to investigate were covered, things like Functional Programming, the latest JavaScript frameworks and tooling. There were also sessions covering things I am more involved with, Agile Process, SOA &amp; Rest, Team Structure and Hiring.</p>
<p>There are other posts around about the individual sessions but I am now much more enthusiastic about functional programming particularly how we could use it and getting back into front end development (even if just in my own time).</p>
