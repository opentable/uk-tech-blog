All was calm and it was time for bed. Two minutes later I had a phone call, followed by a series of Nagios email alerts, and a need to put my work hat on quickly. The search API was having trouble; as the manager of the team who developed it, I was not looking forward to this. We were having a real slowdown at one of our busiest times of the year &ndash; this was going to be fun.</p>
<p>Once the dust settled and we were back up and running we realised we needed to do a better job of performance testing and actually solve any performance issues. We <em>had</em> done some performance testing but clearly not the right kind.</p>
<h2 id="What-had-gone-wrong"><a href="#What-had-gone-wrong" class="headerlink" title="What had gone wrong?"></a>What had gone wrong?</h2><p>We were indexing our data too frequently, and under load it started to take a long time. We created a race condition where multiple indexing operations started happening. As each operation assumed the previous one had either failed or finished a vicious circle occurred making the situation worse and worse.</p>
<p>The simple fix was just to index the data less often or not at all if another operation was running, however we wanted to get to the bottom of why we slowed down under load which exposed this race condition, improve that speed and understand what is the maximum load the system can take.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-a-benchmark"><a href="#Getting-a-benchmark" class="headerlink" title="Getting a benchmark"></a>Getting a benchmark</h2><p>In order to know if we were actually making improvements we needed to be able to recreate load and see the impact. In order to do this and truly appreciate how it was going we needed to use our live environment &ndash; the only environment I felt we could truly understand. My next post will explain why we felt this was the best environment for the job.</p>
<p>With search and availability it is actually quite hard to use response times as a benchmark and the name of this exercise was really to cope with greater load. Response times are still nice to improve though so we were tracking them, but not using them as our main benchmark.</p>
<h2 id="Some-perspective-on-our-problem-domain"><a href="#Some-perspective-on-our-problem-domain" class="headerlink" title="Some perspective on our problem domain"></a>Some perspective on our problem domain</h2><p>We do not have a large index, in the tens of thousands of restaurants rather than millions of tweets for example. We have to merge in table availability (the fantastic thing about the OpenTable system) to the more static restaurant information. We also have large page sizes, needing to get up to 2,500 results out of one Elastic Search request. This proved to be relevant.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/"><h2 class="post-title">Benchmarking APIs - why it’s important, and how</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 28 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/REST/" class="tag post-meta">REST</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/API/" class="tag post-meta">API</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Benchmarks/" class="tag post-meta">Benchmarks</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/SOA/" class="tag post-meta">SOA</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Node-js/" class="tag post-meta">Node.js</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Performance/" class="tag post-meta">Performance</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Continuous-delivery/" class="tag post-meta">Continuous delivery</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Since I joined OpenTable I’ve been experimenting with performance monitoring, specifically on web services. One of the projects my team is responsible for is a REST API that provides UI elements for HTML5 applications, shaped as HTML snippets and static resources. Our consumers are websites deployed in multiple parts of the world, so our service needs to be fast and reliable.</p>
<h2 id="The-why"><a href="#The-why" class="headerlink" title="The why"></a>The why</h2><p>A couple of weeks after joining the company I decided, as part of my <a href="/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time/">innovation time</a>, to rebuild the core of a .NET WebApi project in node.js in order to have a working prototype that could do exactly the same job as the original one, and could help me to observe how the two applications could react with similar volumes of traffic. After managing to make the two apis run on two clean VMs with the same configuration, I wrote a little node.js script to start performing some requests and test the response times. After seeing the results I thought that something was going wrong:</p>

<p>After trying to microbenchmark different layers of the software, I found the problem. On the .NET side I was reading a file synchronously, for every request; the file system’s library used with the node.js app, instead, was automatically caching the reads as default. After setting up a basic caching mechanism in the .NET app and running my script again the node.js API was only 1.4 times faster. After finding and solving that issue I thought how badly the application could have handled concurrency when deployed in production, even if it was heavily unit tested, the specs were well defined, and it was built using all the best techniques we all love.</p>
<p>As developers we rely on technologies that, with a minimum effort, can guarantee some pretty decent results in terms of performance. Modern web frameworks handle concurrency and thread management without requiring much plumbing code. Sophisticated and relatively cheap cloud services help us monitor our applications, providing dashboards, reports and alerting systems. Deploying on the cloud we can run our services and even auto-scale them depending on how much power we need. Even with these tools we must still own the responsibility of writing good quality code, testing it properly, and deploying as fast as possible in order to optimise the delivery process of our products. </p>
<p>But what about performance? I mean, what about the relationship between the code we write every day, and the way we impact overall performance? Are we sure that we are not deploying to production something that is degrading our services’ performance?</p>
<h2 id="The-how"><a href="#The-how" class="headerlink" title="The how"></a>The how</h2><p>Talking about the ‘why’ could be relatively easy, but the ‘how’ is a controversial topic. In my experience there are three important steps to any dish. First, we need the right tools to manipulate the ingredients. I tried many different tools but I couldn’t find a good fit for all my benchmarking requirements. It always makes sense to start with something to get you going but after a while it is important to find what’s the best for you, your team, and your project.</p>
<p>Then, you start cooking: personally, the number of things I’ve learned by just starting to benchmark some services is incredible. Nevertheless, as with every time we talk about metrics, it is key to know what is important about the data we are analysing, recognise the false positives/negatives and be aware of vanity metrics that could emphasize something irrelevant, or, more importantly, hide something significant.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management/"><h2 class="post-title">Programme Management, making Agile scale</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 12 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Leadership/" class="tag post-meta">Leadership</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Agile/" class="tag post-meta">Agile</a></p><div class="post-entry"></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/"><h2 class="post-title">The adoption of Configuration Management</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 10 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/DevOps/" class="tag post-meta">DevOps</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Configuration-management/" class="tag post-meta">Configuration management</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In years gone by, we were a traditional IT company. We had teams of developers and operations. They rarely mixed. Around nine months ago we started to really try and get these teams working together. We introduced a configuration management tool, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppet</a>, into our ecosystem. </p>
<p>Configuration management is one of the steps of continuous delivery that developers often forget. They feel that systems are magically created for them to deploy their application to. I used to believe this. When I was focused on developing software, I never gave any thought as to the work our operations team had to do to keep the train on the track. So give some respect to your operations teams! We created a repository and started to experiment by configuring some of our applications using Puppet. </p>
<p>This was a major step for both sets of teams. The developers started being in charge of the configuration of their application. This meant that their application would guarantee to be configured the same in our CI environment as it was in production. We, as developers, would be more confident of our applications working as expected. </p>
<p>To contribute to the project, as an engineer, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fork the project</li>
<li>make the changes you require</li>
<li>test the changes in a Vagrant environment (already created with a Windows and Linux system)</li>
<li>send a PR (pull request)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have just merged our #847 pull request. The stats of the repository look as follows:</p>
<img src="/images/posts/puppet-adoption.png" class="center">
<p>Our puppet repository has had contributions from over 40% of our engineering / operations teams. We use Puppet to manage our application servers, DHCP servers, provisioning systems and even our MS Sql Server continuous integration infrastructure. The adoption has been fantastic. We started by running our internal QA infrastructure and then scaled it out to our production infrastructure. We now manage 548 nodes (a combination of internal and production) via Puppet. </p>
<p>Using a project called <a href="www.fullybaked.co.uk/articles/getting-gource-running-on-osx">Gource</a>, one of our engineering leads, <a href="http://twitter.com/ryantomlinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Tomlinson</a>, created a video of the repository vizualization. It’s just over two minutes long and shows the activity the repository has taken.</p>

Two days out of ten, seems a lot doesn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="How-we-started"><a href="#How-we-started" class="headerlink" title="How we started"></a>How we started</h2><p>We started doing our 20% time when we had two week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had three days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn’t like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to give it a go. </p>
<p>One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren’t bogged down for those three days. In our first 20% time, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching, let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes.</p>
<p>We got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 20% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the three day test cycle was down to about one day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number one and something no business owner had had to wrestle against other priorities.</p>
<p>After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together?</p>
<h2 id="Failures-not-so-bad-after-all"><a href="#Failures-not-so-bad-after-all" class="headerlink" title="Failures, not so bad after all"></a>Failures, not so bad after all</h2><p>Of course, we have had many failures, but maybe even that helps, we won’t waste our proper sprint time. Some people ask me about rules when I talk about this. I think the key for me is that the engineers are truly given freedom to explore. If on the face of things something they are doing is completely away from what you are doing then it might seem a bit strange.</p>
<p>But what if they are looking to try something new and would have left your company to do so? What if they think it might be a solution but don’t know how to say? What if they can use it in nine months on an urgent project? All these things can and have happened.</p>
