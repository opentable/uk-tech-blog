It strongly mirrored my experience of moving into a leadership role and I’d recommend anyone with a spare 30mins to watch it.</p>
<p>Samantha’s talk made me reflect on how I struggle to coach talented individuals; how I can identify when it’s going wrong and what steps I can take to remedy the situation.</p>
<h2 id="Gold-star-syndrome"><a href="#Gold-star-syndrome" class="headerlink" title="Gold star syndrome"></a>Gold star syndrome</h2><p>A new concept for me and a recurring theme throughout the sessions at DareConf, ‘Gold Star Syndrome’ is a fixation on finding validation for your work. I feel this is a result of early childhood values spinning the perception of working life away from the actual reality. As a child, especially during our school years, we discovered that when we do good things, good things happen to us. Remember how it felt to get that gold star in your spelling test or that A+ on an English essay?</p>
<p>That was great in school and even through to University but working life is a much more terse environment and getting positive reenforcement is much less common. As professionals, the majority of our work goes unnoticed - until there is a problem or issue to solve. Then we feel open to the stinging criticism but resentful that months of good work went unnoticed.</p>
<p>When we continue to search for a gold star or continually strive for perfectionism we, as individuals, become much more insular and isolated. We tend to avoid showing our work until it is 100% ready and put up a shield to protect us from any feedback, in fear of being made to look stupid or being called a fraud.</p>
<h2 id="Empowerment"><a href="#Empowerment" class="headerlink" title="Empowerment"></a>Empowerment</h2><p>There is a considerable amount of <a href="http://whatworksforhealth.wisc.edu/program.php?t1=20&amp;t2=6&amp;t3=84&amp;id=311" target="_blank" rel="external">research</a> to suggest children who have bad experiences and manage to overcome them tend to grow up to become more rounded adults. By encouraging grit and allowing kids to solve their own problems, children learn they are empowered. They become more creative, more respectful, less dependant on others and display less problem behaviour.</p>
<p>This is also relatively easy to implement and can be as simple as involving children in a decision-making process. ‘What do you want to eat with dinner; carrots or broccoli’? This might progress to ‘What colour socks do you want to wear?’ or ‘Which swing do you want to play on?’</p>
<p>The concept of preventing yourself from controlling a situation is really key to successful coaching. Rescuing people by dictating an outcome  requires one weak person and one strong person. This propagates itself so people drift towards being a victim or a rescuer. A much better outcome would be a group of confident, empowered individuals who are able to work together.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/31/coach-dont-rescue/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/22/hobknob-v1-dot-0-now-with-authorization/"><h2 class="post-title">Hobknob v1.0: Now with authorization</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 22 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hobknob/" class="tag post-meta">Hobknob</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>We are pleased to announce the version 1.0 release of <a href="https://github.com/opentable/hobknob" target="_blank" rel="external">Hobknob</a>, our open-source feature toggle management system. With it comes a few additions and several improvements. </p>
<p>This post will expand on some of the changes, in particular, authorisation via access control lists.<br>For an introduction to Hobknob, see our previous post: <a href="/blog/2014/09/04/introducing-hobknob-feature-toggling-with-etcd/">Introducing Hobknob: Feature toggling with etcd</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Authorisation-with-ACLs"><a href="#Authorisation-with-ACLs" class="headerlink" title="Authorisation with ACLs"></a>Authorisation with ACLs</h2><p>A much requested feature was the ability to control who can add/update/delete toggles on an application by application basis. We achieve this via the use if an Access Control List for each application. Users that are part of the ACL for an application are known as application owners.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hobknob-owners.png" alt="Hobknob Owner List"></p>
<p>Application owners can (for an owned application):</p>
<ul>
<li>Add toggles</li>
<li>Set the value of a toggle</li>
<li>Delete toggles</li>
<li>Add additional owners</li>
<li>Remove owners</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an application</li>
<li>See toggles</li>
<li>See application owners</li>
<li>See the audit trail for a toggle</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user creates an new application, they are automatically added as an owner for that application.<br>The user can then add other application owners by clicking the ‘Add user’ button in the Owners panel and entering the users email address.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/22/hobknob-v1-dot-0-now-with-authorization/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-3/"><h2 class="post-title">PuppetConf 2014 - Part 3</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 6 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/PuppetConf-2014/" class="tag post-meta">PuppetConf 2014</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="Day-2"><a href="#Day-2" class="headerlink" title="Day 2"></a>Day 2</h2><p>This is our summary of PuppetConf 2014.

<p>There were even more inspiring keynotes and lots more talks which have given us plenty of ideas to go home and think about.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Notes"><a href="#Key-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Key Notes"></a>Key Notes</h3><h4 id="Animating-the-Puppet-Creating-a-Culture-of-Puppet-Adoption-Dan-Spurling-spurling-Getty-Images-Slides"><a href="#Animating-the-Puppet-Creating-a-Culture-of-Puppet-Adoption-Dan-Spurling-spurling-Getty-Images-Slides" class="headerlink" title="Animating the Puppet: Creating a Culture of Puppet Adoption - Dan Spurling (@spurling), Getty Images - Slides"></a>Animating the Puppet: Creating a Culture of Puppet Adoption - Dan Spurling (<a href="https://twitter.com/spurling" target="_blank" rel="external">@spurling</a>), Getty Images - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/keynote-animating-the-puppet-creating-a-culture-of-puppet-adoption-puppetconf-2014" target="_blank" rel="external">Slides</a></h4><div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 10px;width:50%"><br>  <img src="/images/posts/puppetconf-dan.jpg"><br></div>


<p>Dan Spuring, VP of Tech Services at Getty came out of the gate with a strong message. His <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GSD" target="_blank" rel="external">GSD</a> t-shirt<br>giving you a clear understanding of who he is. His talk about creating a culture of Puppet adoption at his company was a great story of how challenging it<br>can be to move various business units with projects of various ages to a configuration-management (with Puppet) ethos.</p>
<p>I think it is good to hear that they are rolling cm out into that huge backlog of legacy infrastructure that we all try to pretend isn’t there.<br>How do you make it integrate into existing processes? How do you sell the DevOps message at the same time as introducing a tool like Puppet into the mix as<br>part of that message? Dan gave some thoughts on this and it was good to hear some of that from someone who appears to be on the other side of that challenge.</p>
<p>One of the analogies that he used I that found quite useful was that undertaking a project like this is like moving a boulder. It requires an executive sponsor to<br>get the thing moving at all and then it requires everyone pulling in the same direction if it’s ever doing to get anywhere.</p>
<p>The big take-away was that you need to puppetize right away - that you can’t wait for the right environment or conditions to start doing it, you just need<br>start now and demonstrate it. This echo’s the Continuous Delivery ideal of “if it hurts, then do it more often”.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-3/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-2/"><h2 class="post-title">PuppetConf 2014 - Part 2</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 6 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/PuppetConf-2014/" class="tag post-meta">PuppetConf 2014</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="Day-1"><a href="#Day-1" class="headerlink" title="Day 1"></a>Day 1</h2><p>This is our summary of PuppetConf 2014.

<p>As you might expect there were great keynotes with plenty of announcements and too many talks for us to attend. We have provided an outline for all the talks<br>we did attend and links to those we didn’t.</p>

<p>The big keynote of the event to kick off the first day from the author of Puppet himself. This was obviously going to be a tweet worthy affair full of photos<br>and big announcements and it did not disappoint.</p>
<p>Native Clients (CFactor + C++ rewrite of agents) are coming in the very near future. This is not only a matter of improving the performance for existing users part<br>of philosophy of PuppetLabs to become ubiquitous across as many devices and platforms as possible. This is one of those improvements that is really setting up<br>PuppetLabs for the future.</p>
<p>Puppet Server (a.k.a the Clojure rewrite). This is PuppetLabs big move away from Ruby on onto the JVM. Being on the JVM means they can slowly rewrite the<br>codebase while also maintaining compatibility thanks to JRuby. They have gained a lot of experience with Clojure thanks to the PuppetDB &amp; TrapKeeper projects and given how<br>successful that project has been it has helped ease many of the fears people have in moving the JVM. Puppet Server is also a self contained application so there<br>is no longer any need to worry about the whole apache/passanger yak shave. There was even a demo on the metrics that are now exposed by Puppet Server - yes<br>you can now plug Puppet into graphite.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of follow-ups on this that you might be interested in reading:</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-2/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-1/"><h2 class="post-title">PuppetConf 2014 - Part 1</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 6 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/PuppetConf-2014/" class="tag post-meta">PuppetConf 2014</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p><img src="/images/posts/puppetconf2014.jpg" alt="The start of PuppetConf 2014"></p>
<p>It has been one week since our attendance at this years PuppetConf and we have just now caught up on all the great talks that were<br>given and the projects demonstrated over the 3 day period. Here’s our summary of the event (split into 3 parts), hopefully you will<br>find as much inspiration in the content as we have.</p>
<h2 id="Day-0-Contributor-Summit"><a href="#Day-0-Contributor-Summit" class="headerlink" title="Day 0 - Contributor Summit"></a>Day 0 - Contributor Summit</h2><p>For the first time, this years Puppet Contributor Summit was held the day prior to the conference itself and I think this was a great idea.<br>Most of the Puppetlabs staff and many of the high profile community members were in town for PuppetConf anyway so it made sense. There was<br>roughly 60-70 people in attendance both senior contributors and people new to the community so it was a great mix that led to some<br>fantastic discussions.</p>
<p>The day itself had two tracks: a module track for forge modules and a core track for people contributing to puppet and factor.</p>
<p>Those of you who have seen our <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">forge module page</a> will understand why we chose to stay in the module track.<br>Although I heard there were many great discussions to be had with regards to Puppet 4 in the core track.</p>
<p>Each track was split into three sections: a brief introduction from the track lead Ryan Coleman (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanycoleman" target="_blank" rel="external">@ryanycoleman</a>),<br>followed by some lighting talks and then several hours of hacking and open discussions.</p>
<h3 id="Lightning-Talks"><a href="#Lightning-Talks" class="headerlink" title="Lightning Talks:"></a>Lightning Talks:</h3><p>Here is a quick overview of the lightening talks from the module track:</p>
<h4 id="Puppet-Analytics-Spencer-Krum-nibalizer"><a href="#Puppet-Analytics-Spencer-Krum-nibalizer" class="headerlink" title="Puppet Analytics (Spencer Krum @nibalizer)"></a>Puppet Analytics (Spencer Krum <a href="https://twitter.com/nibalizer" target="_blank" rel="external">@nibalizer</a>)</h4></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-1/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/04/introducing-hobknob-feature-toggling-with-etcd/"><h2 class="post-title">Introducing Hobknob: Feature toggling with etcd</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 4 September 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hobknob/" class="tag post-meta">Hobknob</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>The ability to dynamically turn features on/off in software without the need to redeploy code is extremely beneficial. Whether you are trialing a new feature or using branch by abstraction to avoid creating feature branches, the use of feature toggles can aid continuous delivery and provide a mechanism to reduce mean time to resolution when an issue occurs.</p>
<p>With a relatively large engineering department with multiple teams spread across the US and UK the need to manage feature toggles has evolved to the point whereby individual teams have developed their own implementations. Most of these are simple config files.</p>
<p>We decided to unify this effort by providing a central place to store feature toggles, provide a dashboard to be able to turn these toggles on/off and provide language specific clients to integrate into our software components.</p>
<p>The results of this was <a href="https://github.com/opentable/hobknob" target="_blank" rel="external">Hobknob</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Why-etcd"><a href="#Why-etcd" class="headerlink" title="Why etcd?"></a>Why etcd?</h2><p>We made the decision to use <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd" target="_blank" rel="external">etcd</a>. Etcd is “a highly-available key value store for shared configuration” (<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd#etcd" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/coreos/etcd#etcd</a>). It provides a HTTP API to store and retrieve data. This is what makes it perfect for a feature toggling solution used by multiple components. It means that we didn’t have to write an intermediate API on top of a data store for consumers.</p>
<p>So, for example, to store a feature toggle in etcd:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/v1/toggles/restaurant-api/testtoggle -XPUT -d value=&quot;true&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>To retrieve a feature toggle:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/v1/toggles/restaurant-api/testtoggle</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/04/introducing-hobknob-feature-toggling-with-etcd/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker pt.3 - Testing Roles</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 1 September 2014</p><div class="post-entry"><p>In the first two parts of this blog series we have focusing on testing puppet <em>modules</em> with beaker. As an open source contributor there is always<br>a large test matrix so this makes absolute sense. But what about the other large use-case for beaker - what about our day-to-day internal code base?<br>Not all of this is modules, in fact a large portion of it is other puppet code - roles, profiles, facts, hiera data etc. All of this needs testing<br>as well.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will be showing how we have started using beaker to test our puppet roles and profiles for both Linux and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="Master-vs-Masterless"><a href="#Master-vs-Masterless" class="headerlink" title="Master-vs-Masterless"></a>Master-vs-Masterless</h2><p>Prior to this post all our beaker testing has been master-less i.e. using using puppet agent apply. This is perfectly adequate for most use cases when<br>testing modules in isolation but doesn’t always work when testing an internal code base (unless you are masterless there as well then please skip to the next section).</p>
<p>At OpenTable we do use a central puppet master to compile our catalogs. So when testing our puppet roles we wanted to make sure that we were also testing<br>with a master-agent configuration. It is worth mentioning here that if (like us) you are testing windows agents then you are going to need to test with master-agent<br>approach due to the lack of a windows master.</p>
<p>Testing the master-agent configuration means configuring multi-node sets in beaker. There are not many examples of this but the principle is very much<br>the same as the single-node nodeset. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>HOSTS:
  ubuntu-server-12042-x64-master:
    roles:
      - master
    platform: ubuntu-12.04-amd64
    box: ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm
    box_url: http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm.box
    hypervisor: vagrant
    ip: &apos;10.255.33.135&apos;
  win-2008R2-std:
    roles:
      - default
      - agent
    platform: windows-server-amd64
    box: opentable/win-2008r2-standard-amd64-nocm
    box_version: = 1.0.0
    box_check_update: false
    hypervisor: vagrant
    user: vagrant
    ip: &apos;10.255.33.129&apos;
    communicator: bitvise
CONFIG:
  log_level: verbose
  type: git
</code></pre><p>In this example you will see that we are specifying different ‘roles’ for each host in the nodeset. What a role is in in this context is a tag for that node that allows<br>us to reference it directly later when running commands on the host. To avoid any further confusion, from this point onwards if I am referring to the role defined in the<br>nodeset file I will call it the ‘nodeset role’ otherwise I am referring the the puppet role provided in the manifest. There are a couple of build-in nodeset roles that<br>Beaker already knows about: master, agent and default. The first two are pretty self explanatory but the last nodeset role - default - is the location where the tests<br>themselves run. In you don’t specify the ‘default’ nodeset role on any of your host definitions then the tests will run on the first host that you specified in in the<br>nodeset file (which in the case of the example above would be wrong).</p>
<p>You may have a more complicated configuration that you wish to test and this allows you to specify arbitrary tags which can be very useful.</p>
<p>We can now use these nodeset roles to configure our master and agent.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-2-the-windows-story/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker pt.2 - The Windows story</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 1 September 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Acceptance-tests/" class="tag post-meta">Acceptance tests</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Vagrant/" class="tag post-meta">Vagrant</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Windows/" class="tag post-meta">Windows</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Beaker/" class="tag post-meta">Beaker</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/">part one</a> we discussed our first steps into the world of acceptance testing our Puppet manifests.<br>By using Beaker we able to test managing local users on our Linux boxes. This was a positive experience for us. It allowed us to get to grips with the basics of configuring<br>Beaker to run tests and configuring our node sets to run those tests against. In this post, we will be discussing how we went about getting Beaker working with Windows.</p>
<p>As many of your reading this will be aware, OpenTable currently has quite a large Windows infrastructure and we are using Puppet extensively to maintain that environment.<br>We are also moving forward with releasing as many of our modules open source onto the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">Puppet Forge</a> as possible (11 out of 18 of which are Windows<br>exclusive). What this means is that there was no way that we could ignore trying to use Beaker to test our manifests against Windows. We knew that we would have to support<br>many different versions and editions of Windows out there in the community as well that the ones we have to support internally.</p>
<p>This was going to be a challenge (configuration management with Windows usually is) but we were up for it.</p>
<h2 id="The-Preliminaries"><a href="#The-Preliminaries" class="headerlink" title="The Preliminaries"></a>The Preliminaries</h2><h3 id="Serverspec"><a href="#Serverspec" class="headerlink" title="Serverspec"></a>Serverspec</h3><p>The first step was looking at Serverspec. Serverspec is a Ruby gem that provides extensions to RSpec that allow you to test the actual state of your servers, either locally<br>or from the outside in via SSH. What we needed to know was did it support Windows? The answer was thankfully a resounding “Yes!”. All the <a href="http://serverspec.org/resource_types.html" target="_blank" rel="external">resource types</a> that you might want to test including file, service and user are available and supported on Windows. There are also a couple of Windows specific ones such as iis_website, Windows_feature and Windows_registry_key. We even added our own to support <a href="https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec/pull/403/files" target="_blank" rel="external">Windows_scheduled_task</a>. Interestingly Serverspec also supports WinRM as an alternative to SSH when you are testing from the outside-in but we will go back into that later. As long as your using Serverspec &gt; 1.6 you will have all the Windows support you might need.</p>
<h3 id="Packer"><a href="#Packer" class="headerlink" title="Packer"></a>Packer</h3><p>Step two was to build some Windows Vagrant boxes to test against. The documentation on the <a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki" target="_blank" rel="external">wiki</a> was (at the time) a bit slim when it came<br>to building test boxes but we knew we needed Cygwin so we went ahead and created the boxes that we needed. All our boxes are created with Packer <a href="http://github.com/opentable/packer-images" target="_blank" rel="external">and are open sourced on GitHub</a>. They have also been <a href="http://vagrantcloud.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">published to Vagrant Cloud</a><br>so you can download pre-built images and get up and running quickly (version 1.x images contain the Cygwin installation).</p>
<h3 id="Beaker"><a href="#Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Beaker"></a>Beaker</h3><p>So far, so good. We hit a couple of issues in our initial test runs with Beaker: missing module_path, installation using the msi and 32-bit Windows support - but these were very<br>small issues and we were happy to be able to contribute back some changes (<a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/234" target="_blank" rel="external">234</a>,<br><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/235" target="_blank" rel="external">235</a>, <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/236" target="_blank" rel="external">236</a>). We were very happy and managed to get out first module tested,<br>the <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-puppetversion/" target="_blank" rel="external">cross-platform module puppet-puppetversion</a> for doing Puppet upgrades.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-2-the-windows-story/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/08/08/what-can-i-do/"><h2 class="post-title">What can I do?</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 8 August 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Leadership/" class="tag post-meta">Leadership</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Coaching/" class="tag post-meta">Coaching</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Work-smarter/" class="tag post-meta">Work smarter</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Culture/" class="tag post-meta">Culture</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>I’ve noticed recently a lot of content in my social media network is based on the current escalating problems in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Whenever I see such content from a friend or follower, I’m reminded of Stephen Covey’s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00GOZV3TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00GOZV3TM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=helenpieli-21&amp;linkId=RTIUTRBYIE6APBJA" target="_blank" rel="external">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> - Circle of Influence, Circle of Concern.</p>
<p>Covey says that in order to remain truly effective, we should focus our time and energy on situations we can influence. Don’t worry about things we cannot control, such as the weather, the economy or indeed foreign conflicts. </p>
<p>Covey’s work implies that if we identify the areas that are inside our Circle of Influence we will be more productive and make more of an impact;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/what_can_i_do.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>If I’m honest I find this work quite harsh in its approach. Indeed it might not sit well with everyone. However, I personally found myself much less burdened once I could identify which problems I had control over. </p>
<h2 id="Expand-your-influence"><a href="#Expand-your-influence" class="headerlink" title="Expand your influence"></a>Expand your influence</h2><p>I still find myself watching the news, reading press reports and shaking my head at the global problems we’ve yet to solve. Covey’s stance is a tough one to take - don’t waste energy on X, your time and resources are better utilised by focusing on what you can change. </p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’m concerned about global warming =&gt; recycle waste as best you can, be energy efficient with your devices, insulate your home more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I’m concerned about my finances =&gt; learn new skills, look for a better role, try to control your spending, reduce unnecessary outgoings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I’m concerned about my health =&gt; get a check up, start to eat healthily, take regular exercise, reduce tobacco and alcohol intake.</p>
</li>

<p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests">a recent post</a>, I espoused some of the benefits my team enjoyed by reducing our test-base to a single layer of acceptance tests, with no separate unit or integration tests. It caused <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/" target="_blank" rel="external">some minor controversy</a>, which was not to be unexpected. At the time, I knew I had left out some details for brevity’s sake. In this post—spurred on by some interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGloyn/status/456756552092098561" target="_blank" rel="external">questions</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/cgujuv7" target="_blank" rel="external">commentary</a>—I’d like to offer a more constructive view on the subject, and dig a little deeper into the nitty gritty of how we made it work.</p>
<p>I’ll also point out some other hidden benefits of moving to acceptance-only testing, and suggest synergistic practices that can help decide if this is the right approach for your project.</p>
<h2 id="Seams"><a href="#Seams" class="headerlink" title="Seams"></a>Seams</h2><p>After-the-fact unit testing requires us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w" target="_blank" rel="external">find the seams</a> along which code can be isolated and tested. Where those seams don’t exist,  the temptation is to refactor code until they do, using patterns like <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html" target="_blank" rel="external">dependency injection</a>, and following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank" rel="external">SRP</a> and other <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod" target="_blank" rel="external">SOLID</a> patterns.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank" rel="external">Test-first unit testing</a> aka TDD naturally tends to maximise seams, and results in highly decoupled code with small, specific tests. TDD must result in 100% unit test coverage, if practiced according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-Driven_Development_by_Example" target="_blank" rel="external">the gospel</a>. In other words, TDD results in the best kind of code for later <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring" target="_blank" rel="external">modification without risk</a>, and the best tests for detailed, granular feedback. Unit tests also tend to run very quickly, sometimes fast enough to <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/05/07/configure-your-ide-to-run-your-tests-automatically/" target="_blank" rel="external">run every time you hit “Save”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance testing has far fewer seams available.</strong> Typically only one: the application boundary. Yes: <em>Your tests must invoke the entire application each time they are run.</em> Thus running acceptance tests is potentially very slow for even moderately sized projects with few dependencies—let alone large ones with many. Another problem is that, when an acceptance test fails, the failure could be at <em>any</em> layer in the stack. You immediately lose the pinpoint specificity afforded by unit tests.</p>
<p>Why, then, is it sometimes a good idea to forgo unit- in favour of acceptance-tests?</p>
<p>As we will see, the first issue, performance, can be mitigated. The second, granularity, is more difficult to overcome. But sometimes <em>that might be okay.</em></p>
