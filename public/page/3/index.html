It strongly mirrored my experience of moving into a leadership role and I’d recommend anyone with a spare 30mins to watch it.</p>
<p>Samantha’s talk made me reflect on how I struggle to coach talented individuals; how I can identify when it’s going wrong and what steps I can take to remedy the situation.</p>
<h2 id="Gold-star-syndrome"><a href="#Gold-star-syndrome" class="headerlink" title="Gold star syndrome"></a>Gold star syndrome</h2><p>A new concept for me and a recurring theme throughout the sessions at DareConf, ‘Gold Star Syndrome’ is a fixation on finding validation for your work. I feel this is a result of early childhood values spinning the perception of working life away from the actual reality. As a child, especially during our school years, we discovered that when we do good things, good things happen to us. Remember how it felt to get that gold star in your spelling test or that A+ on an English essay?</p>
<p>That was great in school and even through to University but working life is a much more terse environment and getting positive reenforcement is much less common. As professionals, the majority of our work goes unnoticed - until there is a problem or issue to solve. Then we feel open to the stinging criticism but resentful that months of good work went unnoticed.</p>
<p>When we continue to search for a gold star or continually strive for perfectionism we, as individuals, become much more insular and isolated. We tend to avoid showing our work until it is 100% ready and put up a shield to protect us from any feedback, in fear of being made to look stupid or being called a fraud.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/31/coach-dont-rescue/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/22/hobknob-v1-dot-0-now-with-authorization/"><h2 class="post-title">Hobknob v1.0: Now with authorization</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 22 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hobknob/" class="tag post-meta">Hobknob</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>We are pleased to announce the version 1.0 release of <a href="https://github.com/opentable/hobknob" target="_blank" rel="external">Hobknob</a>, our open-source feature toggle management system.

<p>It has been one week since our attendance at this years PuppetConf and we have just now caught up on all the great talks that were<br>given and the projects demonstrated over the 3 day period. Here’s our summary of the event (split into 3 parts), hopefully you will<br>find as much inspiration in the content as we have.</p>
<h2 id="Day-0-Contributor-Summit"><a href="#Day-0-Contributor-Summit" class="headerlink" title="Day 0 - Contributor Summit"></a>Day 0 - Contributor Summit</h2><p>For the first time, this years Puppet Contributor Summit was held the day prior to the conference itself and I think this was a great idea.<br>Most of the Puppetlabs staff and many of the high profile community members were in town for PuppetConf anyway so it made sense. There was<br>roughly 60-70 people in attendance both senior contributors and people new to the community so it was a great mix that led to some<br>fantastic discussions.</p>
<p>The day itself had two tracks: a module track for forge modules and a core track for people contributing to puppet and factor.</p>
<p>Those of you who have seen our <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">forge module page</a> will understand why we chose to stay in the module track.<br>Although I heard there were many great discussions to be had with regards to Puppet 4 in the core track.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-1/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/04/introducing-hobknob-feature-toggling-with-etcd/"><h2 class="post-title">Introducing Hobknob: Feature toggling with etcd</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 4 September 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hobknob/" class="tag post-meta">Hobknob</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>The ability to dynamically turn features on/off in software without the need to redeploy code is extremely beneficial. Whether you are trialing a new feature or using branch by abstraction to avoid creating feature branches, the use of feature toggles can aid continuous delivery and provide a mechanism to reduce mean time to resolution when an issue occurs.</p>
<p>With a relatively large engineering department with multiple teams spread across the US and UK the need to manage feature toggles has evolved to the point whereby individual teams have developed their own implementations. Most of these are simple config files.</p>
<p>We decided to unify this effort by providing a central place to store feature toggles, provide a dashboard to be able to turn these toggles on/off and provide language specific clients to integrate into our software components.</p>
<p>The results of this was <a href="https://github.com/opentable/hobknob" target="_blank" rel="external">Hobknob</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Why-etcd"><a href="#Why-etcd" class="headerlink" title="Why etcd?"></a>Why etcd?</h2><p>We made the decision to use <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd" target="_blank" rel="external">etcd</a>. Etcd is “a highly-available key value store for shared configuration” (<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd#etcd" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/coreos/etcd#etcd</a>). It provides a HTTP API to store and retrieve data. This is what makes it perfect for a feature toggling solution used by multiple components. It means that we didn’t have to write an intermediate API on top of a data store for consumers.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/04/introducing-hobknob-feature-toggling-with-etcd/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker pt.3 - Testing Roles</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 1 September 2014</p><div class="post-entry"><p>In the first two parts of this blog series we have focusing on testing puppet <em>modules</em> with beaker. As an open source contributor there is always<br>a large test matrix so this makes absolute sense. But what about the other large use-case for beaker - what about our day-to-day internal code base?<br>Not all of this is modules, in fact a large portion of it is other puppet code - roles, profiles, facts, hiera data etc. All of this needs testing<br>as well.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will be showing how we have started using beaker to test our puppet roles and profiles for both Linux and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="Master-vs-Masterless"><a href="#Master-vs-Masterless" class="headerlink" title="Master-vs-Masterless"></a>Master-vs-Masterless</h2><p>Prior to this post all our beaker testing has been master-less i.e. using using puppet agent apply. This is perfectly adequate for most use cases when<br>testing modules in isolation but doesn’t always work when testing an internal code base (unless you are masterless there as well then please skip to the next section).</p>
<p>At OpenTable we do use a central puppet master to compile our catalogs. So when testing our puppet roles we wanted to make sure that we were also testing<br>with a master-agent configuration. It is worth mentioning here that if (like us) you are testing windows agents then you are going to need to test with master-agent<br>approach due to the lack of a windows master.</p>
<p>Testing the master-agent configuration means configuring multi-node sets in beaker. There are not many examples of this but the principle is very much<br>the same as the single-node nodeset. Here is an example:</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-2-the-windows-story/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker pt.2 - The Windows story</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 1 September 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Acceptance-tests/" class="tag post-meta">Acceptance tests</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Vagrant/" class="tag post-meta">Vagrant</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Windows/" class="tag post-meta">Windows</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Beaker/" class="tag post-meta">Beaker</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/">part one</a> we discussed our first steps into the world of acceptance testing our Puppet manifests.<br>By using Beaker we able to test managing local users on our Linux boxes. This was a positive experience for us. It allowed us to get to grips with the basics of configuring<br>Beaker to run tests and configuring our node sets to run those tests against. In this post, we will be discussing how we went about getting Beaker working with Windows.</p>
<p>As many of your reading this will be aware, OpenTable currently has quite a large Windows infrastructure and we are using Puppet extensively to maintain that environment.<br>We are also moving forward with releasing as many of our modules open source onto the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">Puppet Forge</a> as possible (11 out of 18 of which are Windows<br>exclusive). What this means is that there was no way that we could ignore trying to use Beaker to test our manifests against Windows. We knew that we would have to support<br>many different versions and editions of Windows out there in the community as well that the ones we have to support internally.</p>
<p>This was going to be a challenge (configuration management with Windows usually is) but we were up for it.</p>
<h2 id="The-Preliminaries"><a href="#The-Preliminaries" class="headerlink" title="The Preliminaries"></a>The Preliminaries</h2><h3 id="Serverspec"><a href="#Serverspec" class="headerlink" title="Serverspec"></a>Serverspec</h3><p>The first step was looking at Serverspec. Serverspec is a Ruby gem that provides extensions to RSpec that allow you to test the actual state of your servers, either locally<br>or from the outside in via SSH. What we needed to know was did it support Windows? The answer was thankfully a resounding “Yes!”. All the <a href="http://serverspec.org/resource_types.html" target="_blank" rel="external">resource types</a> that you might want to test including file, service and user are available and supported on Windows. There are also a couple of Windows specific ones such as iis_website, Windows_feature and Windows_registry_key. We even added our own to support <a href="https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec/pull/403/files" target="_blank" rel="external">Windows_scheduled_task</a>. Interestingly Serverspec also supports WinRM as an alternative to SSH when you are testing from the outside-in but we will go back into that later. As long as your using Serverspec &gt; 1.6 you will have all the Windows support you might need.</p>

<p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests">a recent post</a>, I espoused some of the benefits my team enjoyed by reducing our test-base to a single layer of acceptance tests, with no separate unit or integration tests. It caused <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/" target="_blank" rel="external">some minor controversy</a>, which was not to be unexpected. At the time, I knew I had left out some details for brevity’s sake. In this post—spurred on by some interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGloyn/status/456756552092098561" target="_blank" rel="external">questions</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/cgujuv7" target="_blank" rel="external">commentary</a>—I’d like to offer a more constructive view on the subject, and dig a little deeper into the nitty gritty of how we made it work.</p>
<p>I’ll also point out some other hidden benefits of moving to acceptance-only testing, and suggest synergistic practices that can help decide if this is the right approach for your project.</p>
<h2 id="Seams"><a href="#Seams" class="headerlink" title="Seams"></a>Seams</h2><p>After-the-fact unit testing requires us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w" target="_blank" rel="external">find the seams</a> along which code can be isolated and tested. Where those seams don’t exist,  the temptation is to refactor code until they do, using patterns like <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html" target="_blank" rel="external">dependency injection</a>, and following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank" rel="external">SRP</a> and other <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod" target="_blank" rel="external">SOLID</a> patterns.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank" rel="external">Test-first unit testing</a> aka TDD naturally tends to maximise seams, and results in highly decoupled code with small, specific tests. TDD must result in 100% unit test coverage, if practiced according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-Driven_Development_by_Example" target="_blank" rel="external">the gospel</a>. In other words, TDD results in the best kind of code for later <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring" target="_blank" rel="external">modification without risk</a>, and the best tests for detailed, granular feedback.
